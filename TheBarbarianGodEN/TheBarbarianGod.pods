    <Name>The barbarian god</Name>
    <InitialEpisode>Intro</InitialEpisode>
    <Description>And the day came when the ancient legends and the predictions of the seers came true... The old world buckled under the rage and fierce hatred of countless hordes of barbarians, surging like waves from the wild northern forests, the endless steppes of the East, and the scorching southern deserts.
... And blood flowed, the blood of thousands of warriors, soaking the fertile fields...
... But then the Gods sent us salvation.
One man...
One hero...</Description>

The soldiers around you, with grim faces, are securing their weapons. You take a deep breath and release it gradually, focusing on your feelings. When you inhale again, your mind is clear – no fear, no hesitation. There is no room for retreat. If you lose this battle, the entire world is lost.[/p][p]The blaring, summoning sound of the battle horn echoes. It's time. The soldiers line up and march quickly. You remain at the rear.

      <Text>[p]Nobody expected this. Although everyone knew the ancient legends, no one believed in them. No one could believe that the Old World – mighty and confident – would be threatened by the few wild tribes beyond the Great Wall.[/p][p]Until the day when the countless barbarian hordes, gathered from every corner of the Wild, descended upon civilization like the fist of God's wrath. The northern provinces were overrun in two days. The legions sent to stop the invasion were also overwhelmed. The excellent weaponry and military art gave way to the savage fury with which the barbarians charged into battle with the Imperial army. Thousands died, but the thousands were replaced by millions, and the troops were slaughtered. The brutal campaign was stopped only at the Great Wall – once the boundary with the Wild – with the combined efforts of the Imperial legions and the armies of the kingdoms, united in the face of the looming danger. But even this didn't last long. The frenzied attacks across the length of the wall continued, and it soon became clear that the defense would not hold. The last remaining troops were already being thrown into battle. And the Elite Imperial Legion, a soldier of which you are...[/p][p]You disperse the swarm of thoughts with effort and Hands – one grasping at your waist, the other stifling your scream. You stagger towards the wall, but no impact follows. The stone seems to bend under your weight and lets you pass through itself. In the next moment, you realize that you have gone through a rotating slab, and you are now in some kind of hideout beyond the wall. The darkness is complete. For a moment, you stop struggling and are surprised to find the hands loosening their grip. Another moment, and you are free. You sense the body of your captor in front of you. Now is the time to act.[/p][p][link target='224']You will draw your sword and try to slash him before he grabs you again[/link].[br /][link target='495']Or you will wait[/link].[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]In the darkness, a spark flickers with a crackle and ignites a pale bluish light that glows around you and the tall figure wrapped in a dark, gold-starred cloak. The hood is sharply thrown back, revealing to your incredulous eyes a pale and gaunt face that could be called elderly, if it weren't for the eyes – black and unusually lively. The vertical wrinkles on the high forehead and the curve of the thin, tight lips betray the strength of the mind and will of this person. His gaze is slightly mocking:[/p][p]"I'm glad to see you again, my boy."[/p][p]The High Priest! While your mind desperately searches for the answer to the question: "What could the most influential person in the Empire want from me?", he gestures commandingly with his hand:[/p][p]"Let's go!

The view takes your breath away: the entire city, vast and unfathomable, bathed in ghostly moonlight. A little to the north, the giant dark silhouette of the Great Wall cuts through the night. Above it shimmers the light of thousands of campfires. A deceptive silence hangs over the vast battlefield.[/p][p]The priest makes a complex motion with his hand, and the radiance, now unnecessary, melts into the darkness.[/p][p]"The time has come, my boy."[/p][p]The feeling of destiny and doom resonates in his voice and runs like a current through your entire body.[/p][p]"You will face the most powerful dark force that has ever existed..."[/p][p]Though it sounds incredible and absurd, with every fiber of your being, you can feel that it is true.[/p][p][link target='512'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Your family is from Turil, where you were born, but in your early childhood, you moved to the capital because of the influential position offered to your father by the High Priest. Such an honor is granted to few. Since then, you have the earliest memories of the kind, gray-haired man who occasionally came to your house to talk with your father... [/p][p] "I came because of you, my boy." [/p][p] "But why..." you murmur. [/p][p] "I wanted to monitor your development. As well as in the future." [/p][p] Suddenly, a spark of suspicion ignites in your mind and burns bright: the early training in sciences and martial arts, the special school completed with distinction, the higher academy, and finally joining the Elite Corps... [/p][p] "Nothing is coincidental, my boy. I was behind everything." [/p][p] The silent question is read in your gaze. [/p][p] "I had to prepare you for the mission."

      <Text>[p]"The God of Evil..." you manage to whisper.[/p][p]"I will tell you what you need to know..." the priest pauses for a moment, looks at you carefully, and begins: "Once, Guor was one of the Seven Lords. Once... Before he became the master of Darkness. The remaining six stood against his growing black power. The battle lasted for centuries, but in the end, Guor was defeated and condemned to eternal exile. His soul was embodied in a rock. The curse will hang over it until Guor finds his people – the people who will believe in him and fulfill his mandates..."[/p][p]"The Barbarians," slips from your lips.[/p][p]"Exactly. But that would be impossible while he is a prisoner of the rock. A magical circle."[/p][p]"Then how..."[/p][p]"More than ten centuries ago, the black wizards discovered his soul and tried to release it. If Guor became a god again, they would become demigods. But without fulfilling the condition of the Six, it is impossible."[/p][p]"And they go to find Guor’s people..."[/p][p]"Before that, they build a huge temple around the rock, filled with magical traps."[/p][p]"But what does the God of Darkness need protection from?!"[/p][p]"From the White Magic of the Ancients. As long as the curse hangs over him, he is defenseless."[/p][p]"But wasn't the Ancient City burned by the Celestial Fire?"[/p][p]"That happened later. And you might be interested in how and why the Center of the ancient civilization, so much more advanced than ours, was destroyed in mere moments?... The gods jealously guard their secrets, my boy. The White priests, who dared to look beyond the borders of the Earthly, brought death and destruction to the people and their lands. But the White Magic is still there, among the charred ruins of the Ancient City."[/p][p]"How did the Black wizards manage to initiate the barbarians into the faith of Evil?"[/p][p]"Not very difficult, as it is already close to their nature. The prophets of Guor were massacred, burned at the stake, and finally banished from the Old World. Then they found acceptance and refuge beyond the Great Wall. After many years of wandering, the Wild was traversed from end to end. All barbarian tribes embraced the faith in Guor and the primary command: after a thousand years, all will rise as one, overrun the Old World, and find their god."[/p][p]"But that's happening now! Where is Guor exiled?"[/p][p]"In Alkyria. The small southern kingdom, isolated from the rest of the world."[/p][p]"But somewhere there is also the Ancient City..."[/p][p]"It's no coincidence. Surely you've already understood what you need to do, my boy..."[/p][p]You nod uncertainly.[/p][p]"You must go to Alkyria, find the temple of Guor and destroy it with White Magic. This will deprive them of faith and purpose. Then we will easily defeat them."[/p][p]"And what... what will happen if I fail? Or if I don't want to try."[/p][p]"You will die..."[/p][p]You flinch.[/p][p]"... along with me and everyone else. The defense of the Wall will not hold for more than two weeks. After that, Handzhab will be overrun and nothing will stop the barbarians on their way to their god. And once they reach him... It will be the end of the world. No one will withstand the reborn black power of Evil."[/p][p]You understand or rather sense the dreadful reality emanating from his words.[/p][p]"I accept," you say firmly. "If I must lose my life, at least it will be worth it."[/p][p]The priest smiles wearily and turns. A sudden thought crosses your mind.[/p][p]"One last question!"[/p][p]He looks at you again.[/p][p]"Why me?"[/p][p]His voice is ice-cold serious, as before:[/p][p]"You are the Chosen One. On the day of your birth, there were dozens of omens."[/p][p]You nod impressed.[/p][p]"And now you will meet an acquaintance of yours."[/p][p][link target='609'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

He also serves in the Guard – the other name for the Imperial Legion – but a week ago was sent to the battlefield as the commander of a small combat unit.[/p][p]"Why do you call me 'boss'?" you ask and suddenly open your eyes wide, realizing the answer – "You're coming with me?!"[/p][p]"It wasn't at my request," Slim justifies.[/p][p]"But that's wonderful!"[/p][p]"Bart (a mutual friend) and about ten others are coming with us. We're not underestimating you, but when one faces a god, a whole regiment wouldn't go amiss."[/p][p]Suddenly, the fateful Mission, filled with difficulties and dangers, starts to seem like a Sunday outing to you.[/p][p]"I told you that someday your luck would turn out and here...

      <Text>[p]After a few dark corridors, you stop in front of a heavy, iron-bound door. The priest raises his hand, and it opens with a quiet creak. You step over the threshold and find yourself in a massive dimly lit stone hall. Along the long walls are lined hundreds of dusty shelves and piles of chests.[/p][p]"To complete the mission, you'll need more than luck, my boy. Here you can find everything you need." You start walking along one of the shelves filled with weapons, and before you reach the end, you've already made your choice: a long, massive sword with an ornate handle in the shape of a snake, and a large combat knife with serrations on the back of the blade.[/p][p][image source='5' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='center' width='703' height='128' /][/p][p]You strap the sword and fasten the knife sheath with straps to the lower part of your leg.

Inside, about ten dirty and disheveled barbarians sit on the ground: two women, a young boy, and the rest – large and strong warriors. The leader takes a stick and starts poking one of them, a half-naked, bearded giant. He turns to smile at you, and at the same moment, the barbarian lightning-fast grabs the stick and pulls it so hard and swiftly that the yellow-skinned man crashes into the cage.

In front of the port entrance, you see a board anchored on a post and painted in blue. Some plump man dressed in a naval uniform is scribbling on it. You approach.[/p][p]As soon as he hears the sound of your steps, he turns around, looks you up and down, and continues his work with the chalk. The language he's writing in, more specifically, the alphabet, is unfamiliar to you.

A few meters from the stern, the enemy ship suddenly raises its oars up, exposing its bulging sides. With horror, you understand what will follow. Despite the frantic shouts of the captain and the two sailors trying to restrain the rowers, only two of your oars are raised up to protect – probably those whose rowers have been reached by the whips. The barbarian galley glides by inertia past yours, breaking the oars like matchsticks, and stops. About a dozen grappling hooks fly out simultaneously and embed in the sides of your ship. It seems none of the three sailors know what they're doing. Protecting yourself from the stones raining down from the barbarian slings with a wooden lid, you manage to cut the ropes of the hooks. Slim does the same at the stern, but the four hooks attached to the middle of the ship are safe, guarded by several chained but dangerous rowers. You look over the enemy ship.

The ships’ planks groan and creak. The galleys collide with a crash.[/p][p]A bad premonition has curled into an icy ball in your stomach. You get up and walk on the deck with rising signs of seasickness. Everywhere there is panic and disorder. Unsecured bundles slide back and forth on the wave-soaked planks. You find the captain even dirtier and more disheveled than the night before. His whole appearance suggests that he spent the night in drunkenness.[/p][p]"What is this?!" you roar over the howling wind.[/p][p]"The seasonal winds!" he manages to mumble. "I didn’t expect them so early, gods are my witnesses! Oh, now for six whole weeks, we won't be able to move from here!"[/p][p]You can see that for yourself.

You give him one, leaving him to sprawl on the deck, and start cursing around. You find Slim beating the helmsman at the stern.[/p][p]Black clouds chase each other across the sky.

The next day the weather is even more awful, but you manage to acquire two horses at a huge cost, which you immediately spur towards Handzhab. Even on the way, you realize it's futile. The Wall's defenses have been overrun. You constantly encounter groups of barbarians with whom you fight without stopping your ride. Hope drives you forward, but when Handzhab spreads out before you, you realize it's too late, much too late. Black smoke from thousands of small fires swirls towards the heavens. The capital smolders in its destruction – captured and burned. The barbarians are on their way to their god.[/p][p]Your mission ended in failure.[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]You love tradition. You turn left and push the door of "The Wherry." With a soft creak, it opens, revealing a pleasant-looking room with a low smoked ceiling, supported by wooden columns. A few patrons are sitting at round tables covered with tablecloths, quietly having lunch. You take a seat across from a man who looks like a merchant, who glances at you fearfully and returns to his meal. You look around and with surprise notice that everyone has stopped eating and is staring at you. A small man with a bald head and a stained apron cautiously approaches you.[/p][p]"A lunch, man," your voice booms in the quiet tavern, "and quickly, because I'm starving."[/p][p]"Uh-uh, sir," he says nervously, "I will call the guard."[/p][p][link target='128'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]"Grab a bite" – sounds interesting. You head towards the right tavern and push the door. It opens with a creak. You step inside. Before your eyes, a wide room with a low dirty ceiling unfolds. The walls have been recently plastered, but here and there are large stains of food and wine. About twenty burly men, seated along the two long wooden tables, are loudly eating and drinking. You can't manage to take a closer look because the door swings back and hits your shoulder, pushing you outside again. Annoyed, you slam it, and this time it hangs on one hinge. A chorus of rough laughter comes from inside. For a moment, you hesitate.[/p][p][link target='525']You will go to the other tavern[/link].[br /][link target='568']Or you will still enter here[/link].[/p]</Text>

"I bet my head they're waiting for us on the left."[/p][p]"At this moment, I wouldn't bet a fake opal against your head," Slim grins.[/p][p]You wouldn't give more either.[/p][p]You descend silently down the right staircase, feeling your way along the walls. The steps soon end along with the darkness. You continue down a wide, lit corridor. Suddenly, you halt, drawing your sword at the sight of an armored guard leaning against the wall. Slim turns and looks at you mockingly:[/p][p]"Those are ceremonial armor, fool. Don't delay."[/p][p]The ceremonial armor takes a step toward Slim and swings the halberd. The next moment, they are indeed just armor. He draws his bloody knife, wedged between the helmet and breastplate, and shrugs apologetically:[/p][p]"Even I make mistakes sometimes."[/p][p][image source='30' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='center' width='587' height='667' /][/p][p]At the next turn, you both freeze, having heard voices. Incredibly slowly, you peek around the corner and survey the scene. The voice comes from behind a huge, reinforced door. In front of it stand two guards, naturally, with black masks. They need to be neutralized in an instant. The slightest noise would mean doom for both of you. Slim's hand rests on your shoulder.[/p][p]"Leave it to me."[/p][p]You watch with astonishment the strange object he pulls out, something like a slingshot but with three branches. You can't guess the origin of the elastic strands, but you manage to assess their qualities. Slim loads the weapon with two spiked metal balls and focuses it towards the wall. You move out of his aim.[/p][p]"It's good!"[/p][p]Slim crouches and slightly peeks behind the corner. The guards haven't heard a thing. The last thing they'll hear before softly collapsing to the ground is a sinister whistling. You can't contain your admiration:[/p][p]"Brilliant performance!"[/p][p]"My signature trick," Slim informs you modestly.[/p][p]You drag the bodies to the end of the corridor and return to the door. The monologue continues, growing more angry. You don't know the language, but Slim's expression shows that he understands everything and finds it quite amusing.[/p][p]"That's our friend the Leader," he whispers to you, explaining to his soldiers what a danger you pose... And now they're discussing how to eliminate that danger."[p][p]Slim listens again with interest and after a while adds admiringly:[/p][p]"I never thought a person could be killed in so many different ways..."[/p][p]You swallow dryly. Suddenly Slim jumps and pushes you into the darkness. The door opens, and a dozen soldiers of the "Leather Masks" silently exit. After the last one moves down the corridor, the door bangs shut – the leader is left inside.[/p][p]"Wonderful," Slim rejoices, "now is the moment to catch him."[p][p]He goes to the door, leaving you in bewilderment, politely knocks, steps aside, and lands his fist on the tousled head that pops out from inside.[/p][p]A little later, the leader is tied from head to toe to a richly decorated, inlaid chair. The wide strap wrapped around his mouth hides his pointed chin and thin, nervous lips. His narrowed eyes gleam with murderous hatred from under his black curls.[/p][p]You know you have to hurry because at any moment one of the series of corpses you've left behind could be discovered. Slim reaches to remove the bandage, but you stop him.[/p][p][tag]item:return context.getItem('necklace');[/tag] [link target='script:717' script='context.removeItem(player, &amp;apos;necklace&amp;apos;, 1); return 717;' condition='return player.getItem(&amp;apos;necklace&amp;apos;);']If you want to conduct the interrogation with the Magic Necklace[/link].[br /][link target='116']If you don't have or don't want to use it[/link].[/p]</Text>

He's simply conveying what he knows.[/p][p]"Who leads you?"[/p][p]"One of them remains. He is now the high priest of the country. In the capital – the Lake City. He can speak with Guor. He assigns us the tasks, and the leaders in each city must ensure they are carried out."[/p][p]"Hey, this works better than torture with pins," Slim chimes in.[/p][p]"In which other cities do you have organizations?"[/p][p]"Everywhere."[/p][p]Slim looks impressed:[/p][p]"We certainly won't be bored."[/p][p]"Quiet, damn it!" you hiss. "I'm trying to concentrate."[/p][p]The time has come for the most important question.[/p][p]"Do you know where Guor is?"[/p][p]You sense the captive desperately trying to hide the answer, but it surfaces from the depths of his consciousness:[/p][p]"In the Impenetrable Mountains. By the sea. On a rocky plateau."[/p][p]You look triumphantly at Slim and ask the final question:[/p][p]"Where is the White Magic?"[/p][p]"The ancient city in the Burnt Land. No one can reach there."[/p][p]"We'll see."[/p][p]You turn to Slim:[/p][p]"Let's get out of here! They could come at any moment." The effect of the Medallion has ceased, and the captive slowly regains his senses. Clearly understanding what he has done, there's a flame of horror mixed with insane courage burning in his eyes. A moment before he can scream for help, his mouth is securely gagged again.[/p][p]"Don't leave unfinished business!" Slim says, tightening the bandage once more.

The white spot between them rapidly grows and turns into an enormous cluster of buildings. Aldor![/p][p]Just before entering the city, you are suddenly struck by a feeling that something is very wrong. The streets are deserted. There isn't a living soul in Aldor! The voice surprises you:[/p][p]"Man!"[/p][p]You turn sharply. The stallion neighs.[/p][p]"Help me." – You finally see him: an old man wrapped in a cloak, leaning against a stone by the road. You dismount from the wildly tossing horse and approach him, increasingly puzzled.[/p][p]"Death... came... from... Sard," you barely hear the hoarse whisper. You reach out your hand and pull down his hood. The old man is already dead. His yellowish skin is marred with red spots of decaying flesh.[/p][p]The Red Death! More terrifying than the plague. More horrible than anything known. God's scourge. Horror, Death. You mount the horse and ride south on the detour road to the bridge over Sard, farther away from the infected city.

      <Text>[p]The powerful nostrils of the horse pierce the air and every movement of the muscular legs brings you closer to the goal. The wind crashes against your chest, brushes your face, and flutters your hair in wild waves. The boundless steppe around you sweeps away in the whirlwind of the furious gallop, but nothing in it changes – an eternal green sea.[/p][p]You have been galloping for more than two hours when small villages begin to sprout around you – a sign that the big city is near. Without slowing down, you orient yourself, slightly change direction, and soon the new eastern course turns the flat steppe into gently rolling hills, which become higher and steeper, the grass giving way to shrubs, and then to sparse, scattered groves that begin to thicken. In less than half an hour, the mighty jagged silhouette of the Impassable Mountains rises on the horizon – fresh green forests at the foot, dark pine forests up the slopes, and high above the grayness of mist-covered bare peaks, the dazzling white glaciers on the ever-snowed peaks blend with the gentle blue of the sky above them.[/p][p]A silver stripe flashes through the hills – the Sard! You are already close. You reach the river, still young and wild here, drawing its strength from the eternal ice, and turn the horse upstream. The path becomes steeper and rockier, while sullen cliffs overhang the banks. Dense dark forests spread over their slopes. You are already in the Sard valley.[/p][p]After climbing the next steep slope, the city rises before you – cold and impassable in the embrace of the rocks. From here you notice no movement, as if it is engulfed in an icy sleep. You should have already met a traveler by now – a peasant heading to the city market, a merchant descending to the big cities in the plain, or just a wanderer – but no one but you defiles the eternal mountain tranquility. Unintentionally, you shudder and slightly spur the horse.[/p][p]At the next turn, you finally see someone – a dark figure leaning against one of the roadside forest trees, wrapped in a dark cloak with a hood pulled over – probably a tired traveler sitting down after the long climb. Maybe he will help you with advice or direction. You stop the horse, which twitches its ears, sniffing the air restlessly, and call out a greeting.[/p][p]No response. Either he is asleep or extremely impolite.[/p][p]You raise your voice. No result. The horse neighs fearfully.[/p][p]You begin to get angry. You jump off the saddle and approach the cloaked man. He doesn't respond, even when you shout almost in his ear.[/p][p]"Let's see about that," you angrily pull the hood back and uncover his face. The most horrible face you’ve ever seen...[/p][p]With great effort, you stifle your scream.[/p][p]The "man" was a man many days ago. Now he is a carcass. His face, covered with small white maggots, seems to contort in grimaces at their movement. You suppress the urge to run away and look closer: the skin, exposed in places, is marked with scarlet spots... Oh, Gods! The Red Death![/p][p]More terrifying than the plague. More horrific than anything known. God's scourge. The horror.

There are no testimonies of how the Celestial Fire poured onto the fertile land and turned it into ash, and the surrounding area into a desert. No testimonies, except for the Burnt Land itself.

      <Text>[p]Even the first steps in the City of River Merchants convince you of the appropriateness of its nickname. Every inch here is occupied with piles of goods, ready to be sold. Here and there, fat, richly dressed men hurry around, discussing the merchandise and the number of corresponding stones with a concerned look. Salmodil handles the flows of trade coming from above and below along the Great Tyra. The primary livelihood of its numerous residents is trade between the northern and southern parts of Alkyria, as well as between the western and eastern mountains, and those who are not merchants are engaged in serving the travelers continuously passing through the city. The entire Salmodil is like a massive market, continuously crisscrossed by carts and wagons transporting goods to the waiting boats and rafts in the river.[/p][p]As you walk slowly down the street, trying to immerse yourself in the city and feel what's happening around you, loud shouts and screams awaken you from your amazed daze.[/p][p]You run towards an intersection where an impressive crowd has already gathered, pushing through the people, with your hand on your sword?

They have come from afar with their goods, driven from their homeland. The woman was from here, but when they returned, all her relatives were either dead or poorer than them. They had no money for the huge market tax of Kyra, so she came on the second day.[/p][p]Your insistent questions about Kyra receive answers. Kyra is the goddess of the river, trade, and fertility, worshipped even before the current inhabitants of Salmodil settled here. It was they – the young tribe of traders, who came from the south up the stream – who turned the goddess's name into Tyra and named this part of the river they reached – and their northernmost lineages live up to its sources. Much later, perhaps a century ago, the name Kyra was adopted by a semi-criminal trade guild engaged mainly in shady deals. Gradually – with bribes, violence, or with the help of the population – Kyra's people seized most posts in the local government and changed the old laws in their favor. Now Kyra is the undisputed ruler of Salmodil, protecting traders from the increasingly rare attacks of river pirates and demanding huge taxes for it. Here everyone pays Kyra.[/p][p]Having kindly eaten from the family's supplies, you warmly bid them farewell and head once again through the vast Salmodil market in search of an inn.[/p][p][link target='76'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

And the owners of these have likely given up on them, having left them in such danger in the bushes, relieved of all valuables on their way to hell...[/p][p]After a few minutes of furious riding down the slope, the animal begins to obey your commands and slows down slightly, heading in the desired direction.[/p][p]Soon the road becomes more even, and the steep hills remain behind you. The plain stretches out before your eyes.[/p][p]Where will you continue?[/p][p][link target='207']West towards the Lake City[/link].[br /][link target='595']South to Tilt[/link].[/p]</Text>

You soar from the force of the strike, but the magic protects you from the fire's touch – you feel the lava as a flowing, heavy sludge. Feverishly, you wade to the top of the ridge and slide down the other side. The lava fails to follow you. And it's for the best, as the membrane wrinkles into black ash shortly after the fire stops touching it. With slow, weary steps, you head west in the gray morning.[/p][p][link target='244'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>
