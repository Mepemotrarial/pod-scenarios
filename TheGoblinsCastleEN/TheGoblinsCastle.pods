      <Text>[p]Victory! After all the trials, success is before you. Only one thing remains—to release the locked waters of the forest springs. But how to do it?[/p][p]You look around and nearby you notice a huge silver key protruding from the stone wall. Could this be the solution to your question? You must try.[/p][p]You step towards the silver key and turn it sharply. A rumble is heard. Holes open in the walls, and through them, murky streams of water flood the hall. Now you must not waste a second. You turn and run back with all your might. You cross the antechamber of the throne room and leap into the underground corridor.[/p][p]The water already reaches your knees. The roar of the waters shakes the entire fortress. From all sides, the screams of frightened goblins echo. Stones fall from the arch. You continue to run amid the general chaos. Up, up a steep staircase…[/p][p]Walls crumble behind you. You do not turn back. Now salvation is only ahead. Corridors, halls, stairs again… A door swings open under your heavy impact, and stars flash ahead. You burst into the courtyard of the fortress. The gate is open, and squealing goblins and trolls are fleeing.[br /]You find yourself somewhere far away amidst the forest thickets. Birds sing in the branches. On the horizon, a pale dawn rises, and in it, you distinguish how the black towers sway and slowly crumble down. This is the end of the goblin's castle.[/p][p]Now you can return to the queen of the forest maidens and tell of the trials you had to go through to save the Old Forest. Of course, there will be celebrations and songs in your honor. But glory does not concern you that much. Now you wish for only one thing—to live peacefully again in your little cottage on the meadow.[/p][p]So it shall be. For a time… Because today's victory is not the last. New, even more exciting adventures await you.[/p][p][image source='35' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='left' width='0' height='0' /][image source='35' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='center' width='456' height='259' /][/p]</Text>

You lift your head and listen. It's quiet around, only the whisper of young leaves comes through the open window. It must be a dream, you decide. Who would come in the middle of the night all the way to your small hut hidden in the depths of the forest?[/p][p]But then the knocking repeats. And before you have time to think, right through the thick oak door passes a slender glowing figure—You recognize her immediately—it's your good friend, the queen of[br /]the forest fairies.[/p][p]"Good evening," she quietly greets you.[/p][p]"Good evening," you reply, rubbing your eyes, wondering why she has come at such a late hour. Her radiant face looks worried and sad.[/p][p]"I'm seeking help," your guest responds to your unspoken question. "A terrible disaster has befallen the forest. A few days ago, Pumpkinhead the First, king of the goblins, locked the waters of all the forest springs. If no one fights him, soon everything around will turn into a desert."[/p][p]You rise and sit up in bed. The news is indeed frightening. It's hard for you even to imagine the dried-up springs, the silent streams, the dead trees. This must not happen! And gradually you realize that every minute is precious. Only you can save the forest from destruction.[/p][p]You decisively get up and start getting dressed. A faint smile lights up the fairy's worried face.[/p][p]"I knew I could count on you," her voice rings joyfully. "Come!"[/p][p]Within a minute, the two of you are walking through the night forest. The bushes part before you, revealing a secret path you've never walked before. The trees around become taller, denser. Soon you reach the most sacred spot of the Old Forest—the Fairy Glade, about which you've only heard in fairy tales. In the center darkens a huge oak with a wide hollow in the old, gnarled trunk. The fairy disappears inside and shortly returns with a shiny steel sword.[/p][p]"This is for you," she says. "With this sword, you will fight against evil spirits — goblins and trolls. And now I want to give you some magical gifts. Let fate determine how many there will be."[/p][p]Choose a random number (1-12) and add [tag]info:return 5;[/tag].[/p][p][blocker]$.result = context.roll(1, 12); return true;[/blocker][tag]general:return 'Pick a number (1-12)';[/tag][endblocker /][/p][p]The total number of items you can carry is [script]player.carryLimit = $.result + 5;[/script][tag]info:return `5 + ${$.result} = ${player.carryLimit}`;[/tag].

      <Text>[h2]ENCOUNTERS[/h2][p]In each encounter, the book will indicate how much health and strength the opponent has. Before the battle begins, the ratio of the forces will be determined. This is done by subtracting the opponent's strength from your strength. For example, if you have a strength of [tag]info:return 16;[/tag], and the enemy has a strength of [tag]info:return 20;[/tag], the ratio is [tag]info:return -4;[/tag]. If your strength is [tag]info:return 19;[/tag], and the enemy's strength is [tag]info:return 17;[/tag], the ratio is [tag]info:return '+2';[/tag].[/p][p]Once the ratio of the forces is determined, the exchange of blows begins. To do this, you choose a random number (1-12). It is added to the ratio of the forces, resulting in the attack level.
