      <Text>[p]Today is a day off, and you are happily lounging in the sunshine near your hut in the Old Forest. It's nice to know that work can wait. Moreover, you don't have much work to do. Your life here is peaceful and mostly monotonous.[/p][p]The sound of footsteps makes you lift your head. In the next moment, you jump to your feet and gaze in surprise at the path at the edge of the meadow. From the forest emerges a hunched old man in a long white robe, leaning on a polished wooden staff. His wrinkled face is good-natured, but deep in his sunken eyes lies worry. In your amazement, you even forget to greet him. For this is the great wizard Siyan! Siyan himself has decided to visit you! And it seems he intends to discuss some serious matter with you.[/p][p]"Hello, young man" his voice rings out, surprisingly powerful for the frail old body.[/p][p]You mumble some greeting awkwardly, but Siyan waves his hand.[/p][p]"Forget the pleasantries! We need to talk."[/p][p]As you sit on the grass, the wizard scrutinizes your face intently.[/p][p]"Idleness isn't good for you" he says slyly. "At your age, one needs adventures."[/p][p]"I'm just a peaceful woodcutter" you protest. "Adventures are for wandering knights. I prefer to live quietly and peacefully."[/p][p]"Don't be modest!" the old man interrupts. "For wandering knights, huh? Allow me to tell you, young man, that no wandering knight could accomplish the feat awaiting you. I know you."[/p][p]"Perhaps you're right" you agree. "Especially if it's necessary. For example, if I have to save the Old Forest from destruction..."[/p][p]"Exactly that's necessary!" Siyan declares emphatically. "The Old Forest is threatened by Agamor himself. Have you heard that name?"[/p][p]Does it need asking! For years, ominous rumors about Agamor have been circulating in the Old Forest. Once, he was Siyan's most capable student, but he has since turned to the path of evil and is now one of the most dangerous wizards.[/p][p]"I see you understand me" the old man continues. "Allow me now to ask you a question. How long has it been since you had pleasant dreams?"[/p][p]A strange question... You strain your memory and are surprised to find that you don't remember dreaming recently.[/p][p]"Yes, that's right" Siyan nods. "For several weeks now, people in our region either dream only nightmares or don't dream at all. Their pleasant dreams have been stolen through magic. And only two people in the world have the power to do this – me and Agamor."[/p][p]"But why would he want people's dreams?" you wonder.[/p][p]The wizard shakes his head sadly.[/p][p]"Years ago, when I expelled Agamor from here, he vowed that one day he would return and turn the Old Forest into a kingdom of evil. I considered his threats empty words... but now I realize I was wrong. Do you know that one of the most terrible spells is precisely this one – to steal people's dreams? Through it, invisible black threads can be woven straight to human souls. And then Agamor will become the master of all living things in our area. But fortunately, we still have time. The black magic of dreams is long and slow. If in the coming days, a brave person manages to find Agamor and fight him..."[/p][p]"Do you mean me?" you exclaim. "Wait a minute, I barely understand magic and enchantment! Why don't you handle Agamor yourself?"[/p][p]"I thought about it" Siyan responds with a sigh. "Yes, I was going to search for Agamor and put an end to his misdeeds. But if I do, I'll have to leave the forest unprotected. And not all dreams have been stolen yet. I must stay here and do everything in my power to hinder the black magic. At least this way, I'll delay his plans. Meanwhile, you..."[/p][p]The old man doesn't finish his words. He looks you straight in the eyes, and you realize you have no right to refuse. Your quiet sigh is actually a sign of agreement. Immediately, however, a new question comes to mind.[/p][p]"Alright, suppose I accept. Where should I look for Agamor?"[/p][p]"That's precisely the hardest part" Siyan reluctantly admits. "He is too experienced a wizard and has woven around himself the Veil of Ignorance. I tried all spells, but even the Wise Book can't help me. I've only heard vague rumors that Agamor now lives in some valley beyond the Fire Desert. But where this valley is and whether it exists at all... you'll have to find out yourself. And so, I think we've reached an understanding. At dawn tomorrow, you set off to find our mutual enemy. Do you know the rules?"[/p][p]Indeed, do you know the rules? Just in case, let's state them. Read carefully, for your fate in this book depends on them.[/p][p][link target='Chance'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[h2]BATTLES[/h2][p]Throughout the adventure, you will often find yourself in conflicts with enemies who wish to hinder you. The rules of combat are simple, but you must remember them well.[/p][p]Each opponent will have specified strength and health. During the battle, you will exchange blows with it. To deliver a blow, you choose a random number &amp;ob;1-12&amp;cb; and add your strength to it. The same happens for the opponent. The one who delivers the weaker blow loses [tag]info:return 2;[/tag] health points. [italic]Example[/italic]: Let's assume you have a strength of [tag]info:return 14;[/tag] and health of [tag]info:return 25;[/tag]. You are fighting a dragon with a strength of [tag]info:return 9;[/tag] and health of [tag]info:return 12;[/tag]. You choose the number [tag]info:return 7;[/tag] for yourself, and [tag]info:return 11;[/tag] for the dragon. Your blow strength is [tag]info:return '14 + 7 = 21';[/tag]. The dragon's blow is [tag]info:return '9 + 11 = 20';[/tag]. In this case, the dragon loses and is left with [tag]info:return '12 — 2 = 10';[/tag] health points.[/p][p]Under the same conditions, if you choose [tag]info:return 4;[/tag] for yourself and [tag]info:return 10;[/tag] for the dragon, its blow will be [tag]info:return 19;[/tag] against your [tag]info:return 18;[/tag]. In this exchange of blows, you will lose, and your health points will decrease to [tag]info:return 23;[/tag].[/p][p]In some cases, you can deliver two blows against your opponent. This is explicitly noted in the respective episode. In such a case, you choose two numbers for yourself and have the right to choose the larger one, based on which to calculate who wins and who loses as described above.[/p][p]The exchange of blows continues until one of the opponents loses all their points and dies.[/p][p][link target='Equipment'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

An extremely useful item for someone planning to cross the Fiery Desert.[/p][p]2. [tag]item:return context.getItem('cloak');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] This cloak constantly changes color and blends with the surrounding hues. If you stand still and wrap it around yourself, it would be almost impossible for the enemy to find you.[/p][p]3. [tag]item:return context.getItem('pouch');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] The gift is not magical, but money is never superfluous. Especially when you know a long journey awaits.[/p][p]4. [tag]item:return context.getItem('ash');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A leather pouch with instant-acting poisonous powder. It can be spread in the air or mixed into food and drink. The result is the same [symbol value='ndash' /] the instant demise of the enemy.[/p][p]5. [tag]item:return context.getItem('rope');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] On your command, this rope can slither like a living thing and tie the enemy tightly or assist you in climbing inaccessible rocks and walls.[/p][p]6. [tag]item:return context.getItem('dagger');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A reliable weapon in the fight against evil spirits.[/p][p]7. [tag]item:return context.getItem('fire');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A vial half-filled with brown powder. It looks harmless, but don't be deceived. At the slightest touch with air, the brown powder bursts into terrifying flames.[/p][p]8. [tag]item:return context.getItem('mittens');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] If you put them on your hands, you will not encounter any difficulty in climbing smooth walls.[/p][p]9. [tag]item:return context.getItem('stone');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A magical and extremely rare mineral. If you touch someone's forehead with it, they will be compelled to answer your questions.[/p][p]10. [tag]item:return context.getItem('herb');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] Adventurers and robbers have long known the magic of this strange plant. It is enough to touch any lock with the leaves of the herb to ensure the door opens immediately.[/p][p]11. [tag]item:return context.getItem('frog');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A funny and very useful little animal. Not only can it speak, but it also knows what lie to tell to get you out of a difficult situation.[/p][p]12. [tag]item:return context.getItem('smoke');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A vial filled with bluish smoke. When dispersed into the air, this smoke creates delusive visions in the enemy's mind and distracts their attention.[/p][p]13. [tag]item:return context.getItem('elixirStrength');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] If you drink it, it temporarily increases your strength by [tag]plus:return 2;[/tag] points above the set value. Its effect lasts only for one battle.[/p][p]14. [tag]item:return context.getItem('elixirLife');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] When you drink it, it will restore your life points to their initial value.[/p][p]15. [tag]item:return context.getItem('snake');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] A powerful antidote. It works through the skin. In case of poisoning, it's enough to touch it to your body or simply squeeze it in your hand.[/p][p]16. [tag]item:return context.getItem('boots');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] Their name speaks for itself. Once you put them on, you'll be able to run faster than the wildest stallion.[/p][p]17.

A few drops of it are enough to turn even the strongest stone into sand.[/p][p]18. [tag]item:return context.getItem('boomerang');[/tag] [symbol value='ndash' /] It's not magical, but it's an excellent weapon for ranged combat.[/p][p]When choosing, remember one important condition: EACH OF THE MAGICAL ITEMS CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE!

Maybe your worries are unnecessary, but you still decide that you should not sleep without a guard. After dinner, the three of you sit around the fire and divide the shifts. You choose to keep watch first. For about another half hour, you talk about the upcoming mission, but the fatigue from the long day prevails.
