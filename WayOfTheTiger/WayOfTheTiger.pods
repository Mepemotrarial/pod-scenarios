Today you will become the youngest ever to challenge for the title of Grandmaster of the Five Winds. When your foster father, Naijishi, was murdered by Yaemon, the second Grandmaster stepped into his place. Now, many seasons later another of the Grandmasters has died and the position is open once more for there must always be five who lead the order. You have been invited to challenge for it because of your consummate mastery of the Way of the Tiger.[/p][p]At the appointed hour you walk, alone, across the sands to the Temple of the Rock. It is a huge pillared hall built into the side of an enormous boulder of red granite brought to rest on the Island of Tranquil Dreams by the ice floes of the age of snow, which carved out the Great Valley Reaches of the far north. As you approach the Temple, you see that the monks and a large number of villagers have assembled to watch the combat between you and the other challenger, Gorobei.[/p][p]Like you, Gorobei is an Initiate of the Inner Circle, a devout worshipper of Kwon and a capable fighter. He is older, heavier and stronger than you and has been unsuccessful in one previous challenge, but he is a skilful wrestler. You walk into the Temple and bow to the Grandmaster of the Dawn, a man who looks younger than his fifty years, slim and taut with piercing dark eyes. Beside you, Gorobei also bows, his face a mask showing no emotion. He is clad only in a loin cloth and his rippling muscles gleam with an oil that will make it difficult to keep a grip on him. You must defeat him in unarmed combat in order to be allowed to undertake the spiritual test, which will show whether you are ready to become a Grandmaster. Gorobei turns to you and bows and you return the courtesy. The Grandmaster of the Dawn reminds you that this is not a fight to the death and you may not use Inner Force. He signals for you to begin. Gorobei advances warily across the polished granite floor, his big hands ready to grapple you.[script]context.startBattle('gorobei');[/script] Will you:[/p][p][link target='17']Feint a punch and then use the Leaping Tiger kick[/link]?[br /][link target='35']Pretend to grapple but instead use the Cobra Strike jab[/link]?[br /][link target='61']Raise your foot as if to kick but side-step and use the Whirlpool throw[/link]?[br /][tag]skill:return context.getSkill('acrobatics');[/tag] [link target='80' condition='return player.getSkill(&amp;apos;acrobatics&amp;apos;);']Or you may wish to somersault to Gorobei’s side before attacking[/link].[/p]</Text>

You ask him of the cities which lie beyond Tor on the Greybones river but a look of pain crosses his face.[/p][p]‘Let me tell you, instead, of Doomover, for that is our port of call,’ he says. ‘It is one of the largest cities in the Manmarch, perhaps four hundred thousand souls, and it is ruled by the Legion of the Sword of[br /]Doom. Most spit when they hear the name but they are one of the best armies on Orb. They worship the Wargod, Vasch-Ro, He who sows for the Reaper and they spread fear about them in battle. There are temples to other gods but the Cathedral to the Wargod overshadows them all. The Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom is Honoric, a black heart who has never been defeated in combat. It is said that he once slew a storm giant, single-handed. He is without doubt a peerless swordsman. The order of the Scarlet Mantis has a temple there too. They send their acolytes to the Far Snows for training, where they become used to hardship of all kinds. Yaemon is the greatest warrior they have ever had to lead them. They use the cross of Avatar the Supreme Principle of Good as a symbol, but with a serpent twining round it. In this way you may know one if you see one.’[/p][p]On the next day, you sight the fortified harbour walls of Doomover and two long blackwood ships dart out to meet you. They fly the flag of the Barbican, the Doomover navy. As they approach, a tall man in black ringed mail orders you to heave to. The captain obeys and the sails are slackened. He answers various questions but when the naval commander asks what business he has at Doomover, he looks nervously at Glaivas, licking his lips. Glaivas answers for him, saying that he has come to sell galley slaves.[/p][p]The commander grins, ‘I was going to confiscate your ship but as you bring men we have need of, you may pass through the Barbican.’ With that you are allowed on your way.[/p][p]The Barbican itself is a huge gatehouse, like a fort, which spans the ends of the harbour walls in an arc. The ship glides beneath it and is tied up at the busy wharf. You thank Glaivas for his help and jump lithely to the land. He is returning to Tor to organize the defence against the forces of Vile should your mission fail. He throws you a pouch containing ten gold pieces, saying, ‘Here, you need this. May Fate smile on you, Ninja.’ You pocket the pouch and turn to the city.[script]context.addItem(player, 'gold', 10);[/script][/p][p]Two gates stand side by side. The larger is a huge arch of black obsidian like a rainbow of dark glass. The other, much smaller, consists of two pairs of white marble pillars topped by a portico on which the words ‘Portal of the Gods’ are written in gold leaf.[/p][p]Which gate will you choose to go through, [link target='6']the Obsidian Gate[/link] or [link target='208']the Portal of the Gods[/link]?[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]The wild lands give way to the meadows of the valley of the River Fortune. You pass the tracks of strange beasts everywhere and, skirting a dense and gloomy wood, you find a wide swathe trampled in the meadow grass. Bending down to examine the tracks you see that they were made by a large band of Orcs, returning, perhaps to the Rift, a few days ago. As you sniff the air, a man staggers towards you, out of the waist high grass. He is old and wears a blue robe that is in tatters but it is his face that holds your attention. It is encrusted with blood for his eyes have been gouged out. You call to him and he sits down suddenly, saying that he has no gold and that he has a terrible disease that you would catch if you ate him. You assure him that you are not a cannibal and ask him what happened. He tells you that he is a monk from Fiendil. He is losing track of time but he thinks that he has felt the sun on his face four times since a man called Honoric had him blinded for spying through a keyhole. ‘He was with a Grandmaster of our order, a fine man named Yaemon and I saw them planning a journey north on a map, but Yaemon heard me and I was caught. Help me. I’m starving, which way is the river?’ You tell him to walk downhill if he wishes to find the river, and taking pity on him, give him some nuts, which you have gathered. He remembers only that they were planning to meet a third man whom they called the Deathmage. There is nothing further you can do to help him and so you journey on towards the city of Fiendil.[/p][p][link target='260'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Inside the buccaneer Captain is sleeping, having forsaken his own cabin for the comfort of the Aquamarin. He is snoring heavily, dead drunk.

You eat sparingly and take your leave early, wishing to meditate before you sleep. Relaxed from the meditation, which frees your spirit from the shackles of your aching body your eyes close as soon as you lay yourself down on the straw-filled sacking that is your bed. You drift into a deep but troubled sleep. You see a sleek-oared ship setting sail from the Land of Plenty. A tall resolute looking man is on the high stern castle, his legs braced against the swell. He wears a thick cloak of dark green against the weather and the sun flashes so vividly on the buckle of his sword bell that you believe this is not a dream but a vision. A sailor calls him by name, ‘Glaivas’, and he turns to look at you but then the vision fades and the brilliant blue sky is replaced by sombre purple clouds against which a large and dark castle looms. Three turrets on a great black keep seem to pierce the clouds.

A man rows himself to the beach and steps out, as the Grandmasters walk to the strand to greet him. He introduces himself as Glaivas and, bowing respectfully, he asks to talk to the Grandmaster of Grandmasters.[/p][p]‘You may address us all,’ says the Grandmaster of the Dawn, ‘for we have no secrets on the Island of Tranquil Dreams.’[/p][p]‘Not since you lost the Scrolls of Kettsuin,’ Glaivas returns darkly.[/p][p]‘What do you know of the Scrolls of Kettsuin?’, asks the Grandmaster. The monks wait tensely as Glaivas looks around carefully before replying.[/p][p]‘The Scrolls of Kettsuin hold the secret to the Word of Power, which will bind Kwon himself in Inferno if it is spoken at the Pillars of Change in the great snow-wastes of the north. Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, of the order of the Scarlet Mantis stole it from you many years ago and he has deciphered the Word. It is the month of All-Mother Splendour and for three days the moon will turn red during the Great Conjunction of the Planets – something that occurs only once every five hundred years. If the Word is spoken by the Pillars of Change at this time your God, Kwon, will be imprisoned in the bottomless pit of fire, leaving the monks who worship Vile free to spread their dominion over the lands of men.’[/p][p]At the mention of Yaemon’s name there is uproar but as Glaivas continues an unnatural quiet descends.[/p][p]‘Yaemon is preparing to set out even now from the city of Doomover on the long journey to the Ice Wastes. Though a Ranger long used to patrolling the wilderness on the edge of the Rift, I am no match for such as he. Is there one among you who will try to stop him?’[/p][p]As Glaivas spoke you felt the burning need to be revenged on Yaemon flare within your breast. Your dream of Glaivas, for it was he you saw astride the deck of the ship, which now rides at anchor near the sands, has convinced you that you are destined for this quest and you step forward saying, ‘I shall stop him.’[/p][p]‘You are young,’ says Glaivas, ‘can you succeed where I, a Ranger Lord, would fail?’[/p][p]‘I am Ninja,’ you reply.[/p][p]Glaivas starts. The Grandmaster of the Dawn sighs and says, ‘Yes, I rename you Avenger, for if anyone can succeed, and you must for the sake of all mankind, it will be you.’ With that he turns towards the Temple, and prayer.[/p][p]The city of Doomover lies on the western coast of the Manmarch and Glaivas gifts you a map, which shows the many cities and strange lands which stretch north to the snow wastes. You spend the rest of the day preparing, lacing the iron sleeves to your dark hued costume and gathering together the tools of the Ninja, before spending some hours in quiet meditation. You board Glaivas’ ship in time to sail on the evening tide.

To save time you decide to swim across the narrow eastern point of the star-shaped sea and the chill water is invigorating. At last you enter the narrow cobbled streets of the city of Druath Glennan. The houses are tall and thin, built of dark brick save for the wooden balconies, which almost touch above, making the streets dark and gloomy. You are glad to have disguised yourself as a fisherman since the guards are unmistakedly in the pay of the monks who worship Vile. Their red-shuttered monastery runs along one side of the Square of the Gods, faced by a temple to the All-Mother. You notice a poor house in one of the dingy side streets and, changing into the guise of a beggar, you fall in with the drunkards who are supported there by the priestesses of the All-Mother. You are planning to reconnoitre the monastery to Vile, hoping that Yaemon is within, when you overhear one of the beggars telling the story of how he lost his arm. There is a grimy and bloody bandage hanging loosely from his shoulder. It seems he was once a sweeper in the monastery but was thrown out because of his drinking. Hearing through the grapevine that Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, was visiting the monastery, he foolishly decided to throw himself before the arch monk and beg for his job again. Yaemon, surprisingly, received him but sneeringly told him that even the gutter was too good a place for him. He had a friend with him, a wicked looking man, with a wicked heart. He had the most hideous, soulless red eyes … Manse the Deathmage, they called him. Anyway, just for sport he said he would punish me, and before I know it my arm drops off. I would have bled to death if it hadn’t been for the priestesses.’[/p][p]He gets little sympathy; one of them, his voice slurred by drink, asks him what he expects if he mixes with Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, and the Deathmage, the most powerful sorcerer on Orb. You gather from their conversation that Yaemon had been waiting with Honoric, leader of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, for Manse the Deathmage to join them in Druath Glennan. Now they have set out for a castle called Quench-heart Keep, near the Goblins’ Teeth Mountains. As it is now late, you decide to stay in the poor-house and set off in the morning.[/p][p]You are awakened in the night by the smell of acrid smoke.

      <Text>[p]It is well after midnight when you emerge from the hostel into the cool night air, dressed in your black costume and hood. Approaching the monastery, you can see that the climb to the roof of the hallway, which connects the refectory to the hall of worship, is an easy one because barrels of wine have been stacked against the wall. You gain the roof and descend into a very small courtyard. Turning a corner of the courtyard wall, you are faced with a dead end. The only way out which you can see is a small passageway leading off to the left. You edge carefully down it but snap an unseen thread, as thin as spiderweave, which sets a bell jingling in the refectory. You run on down the passageway, which turns left again only to find another dead end from which there is no escape. The passages are specially designed to lead an intruder to an inescapable hole and that is where you now find yourself. Several monks appear behind you and you frantically try to climb the wall, only to find that it is coated with a slimy web to which you stick fast. You are helpless and can only kill yourself before they take you, by biting off your own tongue so that you bleed to death.

You hold on tight, knowing that without Togawa’s guidance, you would drift helplessly; the skills of the Ninja cannot aid you here. The monk points ahead to a gleaming archway beyond which a silver pathway stretches up into the clouds. Cherubs flock around its pillars and a Guardian Angel, flawless and white, stands between them. This is the Gateway to the Seven Heavens,’ says Togawa. ‘We may not enter yet.’ As he speaks, a sinuous form takes shape on the silver road. It glides past the Guardian Angel and as it approaches, you see that it is a perfect tiger, but its fur is white and its eyes are blue.[/p][p]‘The Spirit Tiger is a servant of Kwon,’ says Togawa. ‘She will help us.’ As the tigress looks at you, she passes on a part of her knowledge.

      <Text>[p]You take some fish scales from one of your pockets and place them on your eyeballs. You can see through them reasonably well but they give you the appearance of a blind man. Sitting down to beg near the entrance to the monastery, you overhear enough to convince you that the monks who worship Vile are steeped in evil, but it is a woman in a black cloak which is covered in the pattern of green spiders’ webs who most claims your attention. She is walking towards the monastery flanked by two monks dressed in scarlet, and it seems they are having an argument. She is bartering a price for a spell, which they wish her to cast in the ‘Hall of Webs’. She is pointing out that if this is their only defence against spies in the corridor, which joins the refectory to the sleeping quarters then the Webs of Nullaq spell is worth more than three hundred golds. You pick up your hood with its meagre haul of copper coins and pad slowly away before lying low until darkness falls. You decide to take advantage of your knowledge that the Hall of Webs has only one trap, the webs of the witch you saw earlier.

You stand at the rail looking back at the receding cliffs. There is only one other passenger, a woman swathed against the sea breeze in ermine who seems to fascinate the crew. She seeks you out, introducing herself as Dierdra and looking around you see that her face is painted so that she resembles an exquisite cat. You have never seen such face paint and the unnaturalness disturbs you. She smiles and asks if you find the journey tedious.[/p][p]You do not reply but she goes on, ‘I would not bother, myself, if I were not going to entertain someone who interests me.’ You begin to talk to her, for some time, and she tells you that she is a singer, but it is when she talks of those who are to be her audience that you become most interested. From her description it can only be Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, the man you have sworn to kill. She talks too, of the man called Manse the Deathmage, a black sorcerer who reveres Nemesis, and can summon beings from the elemental planes to fight his enemies. She does not seem perturbed at the idea of meeting such people but soon her pleasantly lilting voice has you spellbound. Before you realise what you are doing you have told her of your quest. Sick with fear you wait to see her reaction as the spell of enchantment is broken. She smiles and says that she is not really a singer at all, but an enchantress and swears by all that is good that she will help you. She turns away and coos softly twice. A white dove appears in the sky behind you and flies down to land on her outstretched hand. As the ship glides into the harbour at Druath Glennan she tells you to visit the house of a poor family outside the city wall and wait there for word from her. Unsure whether you are doing as she bids you because you trust her, or because she has enchanted you, you disembark from the ship and walk towards the tumbledown shack that seems to cower in the shadow beneath the city wall.[/p][p][link target='300'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]The Hall of Webs is an arcing corridor, like a humpback bridge, which connects the upper floor of the dwellings to the refectory where the monks take their meals. The door opens to reveal a room dimly lit by two flickering candles. Forewarned, you notice the glint of many threads as slender as a spider’s web, criss-crossing the floor. Some of them, you guess, will be attached to bells or traps, which will give you away or kill you. Bending down, you do a handstand and walk carefully into the room on your hands. You are able to balance on one arm whilst with the other you delicately test the floor ahead for strands of web. It takes you half an hour to slowly cross the room but you manage it without breaking any of the strands. You reach the door and, neatly flipping onto your feet, open it soundlessly.

      <Text>[p][script]context.endBattle();[/script]Yaemon falls mortally hurt to the stone roof of the Great Keep. The wind howls and there is a clap of thunder. His face is suddenly lit up in a flare of lightning and, strangely, he is smiling, calm in the face of death. He raises his voice above the sound of the driving rain: ‘You are truly formidable, Ninja. I have fought many great warriors. Your Manmarcher father was one but I triumphed over him as I did over all the others.’ You are about to ask him who your father was when he is racked by a fit of coughing, which robs him of his last breath. Yaemon is dead and you have succeeded in your mission. Your fame, as Avenger, will spread through the lands of Orb on the wings of fear, for you have killed three tyrants so powerful that they could hold the gods to ransom.[/p][p]Yaemon’s scarlet jacket, now drenched with rain and sweat, has fallen open to reveal a waxed parchment, the Scrolls of Kettsuin. You are about to open this when a wondrous feeling of peace overwhelms you and the voice of your god, Kwon, sounds all around you. ‘The Grandmaster of the Dawn named you well Avenger, for now it is Yaemon and not I who will languish in the lake of boiling blood in Inferno. If you had failed the Doom Legion and the monks of the Scarlet Mantis would have swept across the Manmarch aided by the priests who revere Nemesis and all mankind would have lived in terror under the evil overlords you have slain.’ Your wounds are healed as if by a miracle, and new strength floods into your body as the god gives you Inner Force.[script]player.endurance = 20;

You must return the Scrolls of Kettsuin to their rightful place at the Temple of the Rock on the Island of Tranquil Dreams, but your journey will be beset with dangers.

      <Text>[p][bold]BACKGROUND[/bold][/p][p]On the magical world of Orb, alone in a sea that the people of the Manmarch call Endless, lies the mystical island of Tranquil Dreams.[/p][p]Many years have passed since the time when, as an infant you first saw its golden shores and emerald rice meadows. A servant brought you, braving the distant leagues of the ponderous ocean from lands to which you have never returned. Your loyal servant laid you, an orphan, at the steps of the Temple of the Rock praying that the monks would care for you for she was frail and dying of a hideous curse.[/p][p]Monks have lived on the island for centuries, dedicated to the worship of their God, Kwon, He who speaks the Holy Words of Power, Supreme Master of Unarmed Combat. They live only to help others resist the evil that infests the world. Seeing that you were alone and needed care, the monks took you in and you became an acolyte at the Temple of the Rock. Nothing was made of the strange birthmark, shaped like a crown, which you carry on your thigh, though you remember that the old servant insisted that it was of mystical importance. Whenever you have asked about this the monks have bade you meditate and be patient.[/p][p]The most ancient and powerful of them all, Naijishi, Grandmaster of the Dawn, became your foster-father. He gave you guidance and training in the calm goodness of Kwon, knowledge of men and their ways and how to meditate so that your mind floats free of your body and rides the winds in search of truth.[/p][p]From the age of six, however, most of your time has been spent learning the Way of the Tiger. Now, you are a Ninja, a master of the martial arts and a deadly assassin who can kill the most powerful enemies unseen and unsuspected. Like a tiger, you are strong, stealthy, agile, patient in the stalking of prey and deadly. In the Land of Plenty and the Manmarch the fabled Ninja, known as the ‘Men with no Shadow’, are held in awe – the mere mention of Ninja strikes fear into people’s hearts. But you are one of the few who worship Kwon and follow the Way of the Tiger. You use your skill as a bringer of death to rid the world of evil-doers.[/p][p]At an early age you hung by the hands for hours on end from the branches of trees to strengthen your arms. You ran for miles, your light-footed speed enough to keep a thirty foot ribbon trailing above the ground. You trod tightropes, as agile as a monkey. Now you swim like a fish and leap like a tiger, you move like the whisper of the breeze and glide through the blackest night, like a shade. Before he died Naijishi taught you the Ninja’s Covenant.[/p][p]NINJA NO CHIGIRI[br /]‘I will vanish into the night; change my body to wood or stone; sink into the earth and walk through walls and locked doors. I will be killed many times, yet will not die; change my face and become invisible, able to walk among men without being seen.’[/p][p]It was after your foster-father, Naijishi’s death that you began to live the words of the Covenant. A man came to the island, Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame. Using borrowed sorcery he tricked the monks into believing that he was a worshipper of Kwon from the Greater Continent. He was indeed a monk but he worshipped Kwon’s twisted brother, Vile, who helps the powerful to subdue the weak, and wicked men to rule fools. Yaemon slew Naijishi – no one could match him in unarmed combat and he stole the Scrolls of Kettsuin from the Temple. Once more you knew the pain of loss for you had loved Naijishi as a father. You swore an oath to Kwon that one day you would avenge his death. You have honed your skills helping the downtrodden in the Land of Plenty but now the time has come to prove yourself to your brother monks at the Temple of the Rock.[/p][p][link target='Combat']Continue to the Rules section[/link].[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p][bold]COMBAT[/bold][/p][p]As a Master of Taijutsu, the Ninja’s art of unarmed combat, you have four main ways of fighting. Throwing [tag]item:return context.getItem('shuriken');[/tag] (see under skills), kicks, punches or throws. You will be told when you can use Shuriken.[/p][p]In general it will be harder to hit an opponent when kicking but a kick will do more damage. A throw if successful, will allow you to follow up with a possible ‘killing blow’, but if you fail a throw your Defence against an opponent will be lower, as you are open to attack. Whenever you are in a combat you will be asked which type of attack you wish to make. See the Way of the Tiger Illustrations for the different types of kicks, punches and throws available to you. You will be told which paragraph to turn to, depending on your choice. When you are resolving combat, you will find it useful to record your opponent’s Defence and Endurance score. A number of Encounter Boxes are provided with your Character Sheet for this purpose. The combats have been presented in such a way that it is possible for you to briefly examine the rules and begin play almost immediately. However, if you do this, don’t forget about Blocking and Inner Force, as you won’t be told when to use these in the text.[/p][p]PUNCH[/p][p]You will be told what Defence number your opponent has against a punch. Roll two dice, and if the score is higher than his or her Defence number, you have successfully punched your opponent. In this case, roll one more die. The result is the amount of damage you have inflicted on your opponent. Subtract it from his Endurance totals. If this has reduced your opponent’s score to 0 or less, you have won. When your opponent attacks you, you will be given your Defence number for that combat. Roll two dice, if the score is greater than this number, you have been hit. The amount of damage inflicted upon you depends on the opponent and will be noted in the paragraph. Usually in the format of ‘Damage: 1 Die + 1’ or ‘2 Dice’ or ‘1 Die + 2’. Simply roll the required number of dice and add the number given. This is the total damage inflicted upon you. However before you subtract this score from your Endurance, you may choose to try and block or parry the attack (see Block).[/p][p]Punch Modifier[br /]Whenever you make a ‘Punch Roll’ to determine whether or not you have successfully struck an opponent, add or subtract your Punch Modifier. This Modifier reflects your skill in using the punches of the Way of the Tiger. You begin with a Punch Modifier of 0, as noted on your Character Sheet. This will rise as you progress in The Way of the Tiger and may change throughout the adventure.[/p][p]Punch Attacks[/p][p][image source='29' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='center' width='610' height='265' /][/p][p]KICK[/p][p]The kick and the Kick Modifier work exactly as the Punch except that when you roll the dice to determine the damage you inflict, add 2 to the dice – a kick is more amazing than a punch.[/p][p]Kick Attacks[/p][p][image source='162' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='center' width='497' height='567' /][/p][p]THROW[/p][p]The throw and Throw Modifier work as the punch. However, if you are successful, no damage is done to your attacker, but you will be allowed another attack, a punch or kick, and it will be much easier to strike a thrown opponent. If you are successful with this, your follow up attack, add 2 to the damage you inflict.[/p][p]Throw Attacks[/p][p][image source='163' title='' hspace='0' vspace='0' align='center' width='572' height='975' /][/p][p]THE NINJA’S ENDURANCE[/p][p]You begin the game with 20 points of Endurance. Keep a running total of your Endurance score on your Character Sheet. It will probably be the category that will change most as you are wounded, healed etc. When you reach 0 Endurance or less, you are dead and your adventure ends.[/p][p]THE BLOCK[/p][p]As a Ninja, a master of Taijutsu, you have the ability to block or parry incoming blows with various parts of your body, often your forearms. For this purpose, thin lightweight iron rods have been sewn into your sleeves enabling you to block even swords and other weapons. During combat, if you have been hit, you may try to block the blow and take no damage. Roll two dice. If the score is less than your Defence given in that combat, you have successfully blocked the blow, and take no damage. If your score is equal to or greater than your Defence, you take damage in the normal way. In any case, because you have taken the time to block, your next attack is less effectual, as your opponent has had more time to react. Whether your block is successful or not, subtract 2 from your Punch, Kick and Throw Modifier for your next attack only. Remember, you can only block blows.[/p][p]INNER FORCE[/p][p]Through meditation and rigorous training you have mastered the ability to unleash spiritual or Inner power through your body in the same way as the karate experts of today break blocks of wood and bricks. In any combat, before you roll the dice to determine if you will hit or miss an opponent, you may choose to use Inner Force. If you do, deduct one point from your Inner Force score. This is used up whether or not you succeed in striking your opponent. If you are successful, however, double the score you roll when determining the amount of damage you inflict. When your Inner Force is reduced to 0, you may no longer use Inner Force. So use it wisely! You begin the game with 5 points of Inner Force.[/p][p]FATE[/p][p]Luck plays its part and the goddess Fate has great power on the world of Orb. Whenever you are asked to make a Fate Roll, roll two dice and add or subtract your Fate Modifier. If the score is 7-12, you are lucky and Fate has smiled on you. If the score is 2-6 you are unlucky and Fate has turned her back on you. You begin your adventure with a Fate Modifier of 0.[/p][p][link target='Skills']Continue to the Skills section[/link].[/p]</Text>

    <Episode Id="Skills" IsMarked="true" Location="52.5;17.5">
      <Text>[p][bold]THE SKILLS OF THE WAY OF THE TIGER[/bold][/p][p]You have been trained in ninjitsu all or your life. Your senses of smell, sight and hearing have been honed to almost superhuman effectiveness. You are well versed in woodcraft, able to track like a bloodhound, and to cover your own tracks. Your knowledge of plants and herb lore enables you to live off the land. You are at the peak of physical fitness, able to run up to 50 miles a day and swim like a fish. Your training included horsemanship, a little ventriloquism, meditation, the ability to hold yourself absolutely still for hours on end, perfecting your balance, and ‘The Seven Ways of Going’ or disguise. The latter skill involves comprehensive training so that you can perform as a minstrel, for instance, if this disguise is used. However, a major part of this training has been stealth, hiding in shadows, moving silently, and, to breathe as quietly as possible, enabling you to move about unseen and unheard. You begin the game with these skills. There are nine other skills. One of these, Shurikenjitsu, is always taught to a Ninja in training. This you must take, but you may then choose three other skills from the remaining eight.[/p][p]SHURIKENJITSU[/p][p]You begin the adventure with five ‘Shuriken’. The type you specialise in are ‘throwing stars’, small razor sharp star shaped disks of metal. You can throw these up to a range of about 30 feet with devastating effect. If you throw a Shuriken, you will be given a Defence number for your target. Roll two dice, and if the score is higher than the Defence number, you will have hit your target. If this is the case, roll one die. The score is the amount of damage the Shuriken does. Subtract it from your target’s Endurance. You may find yourself in a position where you are unable to retrieve a Shuriken once you have thrown it. Keep a running total in the box provided on your Character Sheet, crossing off a Shuriken each time you lose one. If you have none left, you can no longer use this skill.[/p][p]ARROW CUTTING[/p][p]Requiring excellent muscular co-ordination, hand and eye judgement and reflexes, this skill will enable you to knock aside, or even catch, missiles such as arrows or spears.[/p][p]ACROBATICS[/p][p]The ability to leap and jump using flips, cartwheels etc. like a tumbler or gymnast.[/p][p]IMMUNITY TO POISONS[/p][p]This involves taking small doses of virulent poisons over long periods of time, slowly building up the body’s resistance. This enables the Ninja to survive most poison attempts.[/p][p]FEIGNING DEATH[/p][p]Requiring long and arduous training, a Ninja with this ability is able to slow down his heart rate and metabolism through will power alone, thus appearing to be dead.[/p][p]ESCAPOLOGY[/p][p]A Ninja with this skill is able to dislocate the joints of the body and to maximise the body’s suppleness, allowing movement through small spaces, and escape from bonds and chains by slipping out of them.[/p][p]POISON NEEDLES[/p][p]Sometimes known as spitting Needles, a Ninja with this skill can place small darts, coated with a powerful poison that acts in the blood stream, onto his tongue. By curling the tongue into an ‘O’ shape and spitting or blowing, the dart can be propelled up to an effective range of about 15 feet. A useful surprise attack, the source of which is not always perceptible.[/p][p]PICKING LOCKS, DETECTING AND DISARMING TRAPS[/p][p]The ability to open locked doors, chests etc. A Ninja with this skill would carry various lockpicks in the pockets of his costume, including a small crowbar or jemmy. You are also trained to notice traps and to use the lock-picking tools to disarm them.[/p][p]CLIMBING[/p][p]Comprehensive training in the use of a Grappling Hook and hand and foot clamps, or Cat’s Claws. The padded four-pronged hook has 40 feet of rope attached to it. Used to hook over walls, niches etc., allowing the Ninja to pull himself up the rope. The Cat’s Claws are spiked clamps, worn over the palm of the hand and the instep of the feet, enabling the Ninja to imbed his Claws into a wall and climb straight up like a fly, and even to crawl across ceilings.[/p][p]Choose three of those skills:[/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('arrowCutting');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('arrowCutting');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('acrobatics');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('acrobatics');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('posionImmunity');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('posionImmunity');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('feignDeath');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('feignDeath');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('escapology');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('escapology');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('poisonNeedles');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('poisonNeedles');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('disarming');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('disarming');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][symbol value='bull' /][clicker]return context.addOrRemoveSkill('climbing');[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('climbing');[/tag][endclicker /][/p][p][link target='script:Tools' script='if (player.getSkillCount() &lt; context.MAX_SKILL_COUNT) {

      <Text>[p][bold]NINJA TOOLS[/bold][/p][p]As well as any equipment you may take depending on your skills, as a Ninja you will have certain tools with you from the beginning. These are:[/p][p]THE NINJA COSTUME[/p][p]During the day you would normally be disguised as a traveller, beggar or suchlike. At night when on a mission, you would wear costume. This consists of a few pieces of black cloth. One piece is worn as a jacket covering the chest and arms, two others are wound around each leg and held in at the waist. Finally, a long piece of cloth is wrapped around the head, leaving only the eyes exposed. The reverse side of the costume can be white, for travel on snowy ground or green, for travel in woods or grasslands.[/p][p]IRON SLEEVES[/p][p]Sewn into the sleeves of your costume, are four thin strips of iron, the length of your forearm. These allow you to parry or block blows from swords and other cutting weapons.[/p][p]BREATHING TUBE[/p][p]Made from bamboo, this can be used as a snorkel allowing you to remain under water for long periods of time. It can also be used as a blow-pipe in conjunction with the [tag]skill:return context.getSkill('poisonNeedles');[/tag] skill, for added range.[/p][p]GAROTTE[/p][p]A specialised killing tool of the Ninja, this is a length of wire used to assassinate enemies by strangulation.[/p][p]FLASH POWDER[/p][p]This powder, when thrown in any source of flame, causes a blinding flash. You have enough for one use only.[/p][p]FLINT AND TINDER[/p][p]Used for making fires.[/p][p]SPIDERFISH[/p][p]Salted and cured, this highly venomous fish is used as a source for the deadly poison used in conjunction with the [tag]skill:return context.getSkill('poisonNeedles');[/tag] skill, and as a useful way of removing any guardian beasts.[/p][p]THE BLOOD OF NIL[/p][p]You also carry one dose of the most virulent poison known on Orb. This venom is extremely difficult and very dangerous to collect for it is taken from the barb of a scorpion son of the God, Nil, Mouth of the Void.[/p][p]With these skills and weapons at your disposal you are now a Ninja warrior and ready to take the first step in The Way of the Tiger.[/p][p]Continue to [link target='Special instructions']Special instructions[/link].[/p]</Text>

You notice that they are adept at keeping out of people’s way. As you walk briskly through the busy streets hoping to find a tavern where you may learn about ports on the Endless Sea, a sudden flare of light catches your eye. A wizened old woman bends over a battered cart which has lost its wheels and been turned upside down to serve as a shop counter. On the boards lie a great many unusual things; some which she claims to be the internal organs of exotic beasts such as chimaerae or hippogriffs, useful in magical rites, look more like sheep’s offal to you, but the sudden flaring of light is unmistakable.

Whirling about, you see a tall man with very curly hair dyed a bright corn yellow, contrasting with the shadowy sable cloak which he wears, walking away through the crowd. They seem to melt away from him. He is far from inconspicuous and you follow at a run, but he disappears suddenly. He has turned invisible.

You are graciously received by Singing Wind, in her beautiful house on the highest of Lemné’s seven hills. You are enjoying the ceremony of the taking of tea with her when a messenger arrives. He bears a rod of ivory carrying the seal of Kiyamo, and he entreats you to travel to the daimio’s palace saying that the Island of Tranquil Dreams is in danger.

He wears a grey surcoat with an unfurled scroll emblazoned across his chest, a symbol, which holds no significance to you. He asks to look at it and you sense that it is safe to let him hold it. His brows furrow in concentration and he murmurs quietly until the sword leaps from his hands into the air, ready to do his bidding. The adventurers exclaim out loud. This is a sword of wondrous power, but it needs a command of the magic language used on spell-casting scrolls in order for it to be usable. Taflwr, of the Illustran priesthood, suggests to Eris that he give you the Sun-Star ring so that Vespers can keep the sword. Eris protests but Thybault adds the weight of his argument to Taflwr’s and, at length, he gives you the Sun-Star jewel.[script]context.removeItem(player, 'dancingSword');

After a while the huge lumbering creature stops breaking up wood and, gathering a mass of logs in its huge arms, it shuffles up to the rock-face and growls at it. You can just make out the word ‘Baal’. There is a rumble and a slab of stone swings outward from the rock and the O-Bakemono shuffles into the darkness beyond, the door closing behind it. You wait a half hour and then step to the rock-face. Beside the tracks of the O-Bakemono you can also see that the grass has been scorched, and fluted grooves some two feet wide have been left in the earth, as if something heavy and tubular had been dragged along it, disappearing into the rock-face. You speak the word and the rock opens again. A cave mouth yawns before you. You walk into it and it narrows to a winding corridor lit with torches. Eventually, the tunnel opens out into a large cavern with a huge fire in the middle. On the far wall is a crude altar stained with ominous black patches and adorned with black candles and a hideous idol, a few feet in height, of a creature half man, half insect. In the corner lies a pile of material and the possessions of the villagers that are of any worth. Just ahead of you is a young girl, the farmer’s daughter, chained to a stake near the fire, her face streaked with tears and the dirt of the cavern. Nearest you, and with its back to you, sits the O-Bakemono, chewing on a raw goat’s leg. But, rearing up before the girl and taunting her cruelly, is the worst and most incredible sight of all: an enormous twenty foot serpent with coils at least two feet wide, and with the torso of a human woman. Her eyes are green and luminous, her face twisted and evil and framed with long tangled black hair; she has fanged teeth protruding from red lips – she is the Hannya, a witch who worships a Demonlord and in return is given the body of a serpent.

He runs towards its forbidding bulk and you see that it is a great church with tall circular towers, around the outside of which spiral staircases twine like great serpents. Snake-head gargoyles with gaping mouths threaten the streets below. You see the door to a stable move slightly and you dart in, past the whinnying horses, where you are in time to see a trap-door shutting behind some sheaves of barley-stalks. You leap over the straw and listen carefully at the trap-door. The sound of two sets of receding footsteps suggests it is safe to open the door and you drop down to a damp stone stairway below.[/p][p]The stairs lead downwards and in the direction of the forbidding church. Narrow shafts lead up to sky-lights at intervals and the man you are silently following becomes visible once more, running beside a man in a flowing grey robe. They run out into a large ill-lit cellar and around a corner. You follow stealthily until the sound of a door slamming shut and a bolt driven home stops you in your tracks. Looking round you see an unusually handsome young woman dressed in a bizarre patchwork of armour; her face is hard and she looks contemptuous. She has shut and barred a heavy oak door across the bottom of the damp staircase. It seems that rather than fleeing from you she has trapped you. ‘Your fame is spreading across the land, Ninja. It is a shame for you that you met a friend of ours in Fortune Pass, Olvar, a kind and gentle barbarian from the northern lands.’ She smiles as the two men whom you had been chasing step into sight at the other end of the cellar. The tall thief with the yellow hair stands beside a magician who bears cabalistic signs on his flowing grey robes, and wears a large gold ear-ring in one ear. As you look into their callous eyes you feel that they could not summon up a drop of kindness between them. The woman tells you that her name is Cassandra. The others must be the men mentioned with her on the board near the gate – Tyutchev and Thaum – who with Olvar, the man you killed when he attacked you mindlessly in Fortune Pass, murdered Aurora, the high priestess at the cathedral to Illustra.[/p][p]Cassandra says that they are going to take their revenge for Olvar’s death.

It turns, getting narrower and narrower, as it spirals down into the bones of the mountain, until you are suddenly faced with a dead end. You turn, but before you can race back up the tunnel a barbed metal grille slams from ceiling to floor, trapping you. The goblins stand on the other side gloating and cackling gleefully.

      <Text>[p]After a day’s journey through the mountains, night has fallen and you are looking down on a myriad tiny lights – the camp of Jikkyu’s army. You descend from the foothills and wend your stealthy way across the open fields, studded with wooded groves, towards the camp. You come to a line of perimeter sentry pickets, each marked by a fire some fifty yards apart, with two guards at each. Your night vision is excellent and you crawl soundlessly towards one, your black costume merging into the shadows of the night. You throw a stone onto the fire. A crack – the sentries glance for a moment at the fire and away again, their eyes momentarily blinded – and you glide past them like a ghost. Soon you are at the outer edge of an enormous expanse of tents. In the centre is a large dark pavilion, unadorned, save for a red flag fluttering at its top, almost certainly Jikkyu’s tent. Crouching low, you make your way inward, avoiding the night patrols – some of which are squat and misshapen, long arms ending in talons – the Bakemono. Like a spectre you rise out of the night and catch a lone sentry with your Garotte, soundlessly choking the life out of him. Putting on his armour and weapons you walk openly to the large tent, unchallenged.

Its fur is pure white and its eyes, completely blue, gaze serenely upon you, filling you with quiet strength and calm. Suddenly its mouth opens, revealing a gaping maw lined with many razor-sharp bloodstained teeth and it roars. A rushing wind blows forth, smothering you in a fetid, choking stench and another face grows out of the yawning blackness of the mouth, completely blotting out the white tiger’s and its blue, blue eyes, still serene and somehow imbued with tranquillity. Ahead of you now is the face of a Ninja, the black hood obscuring all features, save two black eyes, glinting malevolently.

However the O-Bakemono seems untroubled by the Garotte. It simply reaches behind its back and lifts, dashing you to the ground before it with a roar.

The carving is crude but the likeness is enough to suggest something truly hideous and the eyes seem to claim your attention as you strain to see if one of them is moving to look at you. Your scalp crawls. The carvings beneath it show that goblins sacrifice their own people to it, in the absence of victims of other races.

It clears as if a mist had been blown out of it and the hatchet-face of Ulrik Skarsang’s adviser appears, a black whirlpool painted on his right cheek.

It lies in a shallow valley between two peaks, surrounded by magnificent ornamental gardens and a high stone wall punctuated by tall watchtowers. The main gate is hung with banners, emblazoned with the Mons of Kiyamo, glittering in the sun. You approach the guards at the gate and hand them the ivory token.

Your guards bow and leave you. A man in white robes adorned with stylised flowers of deep ultramarine comes into the hall. He has two swords, one long and the other short, tucked into a sash at his waist. He introduces himself as Onikaba, Kiyamo’s chief adviser, and tells you he has recently returned from the Island of Tranquil Dreams where he has talked much with the Grandmaster of the Dawn. It seems they know of your success in retrieving the Scrolls of Kettsuin and they pray to Kwon for your safe return. He leads you into a long chamber of polished wood where Lord Kiyamo sits cross-legged in front of a low table, covered in scrolls and maps. Armed Samurai line the walls. He motions for you to sit beside him and tea is served. He is a man in middle years, his shoulders and arms heavy with muscle from repeated practice with the sword. A white bandage swathes his left shoulder, a recent wound. Then Kiyamo speaks:[/p][p]‘Your fame has come before you, Ninja and Avenger. The followers of Vile, Nemesis and Vasch-Ro are howling for your blood whilst the followers of other gods are laughing up their sleeves. All that is clean and wholesome on Orb is rejoicing. I congratulate you.’ He bows before you. You thank him and he continues, ‘You are too late to help us here I’m afraid. Luckily we managed to win a great victory without your aid. An evil daimio, Jikkyu, had massed a large army of Ronin, bandits and Bakemono or goblins with which he had conquered most of the south. He had the aid of the priests of Nemesis and the monks of Vile and had planned an evasion of the Island of Tranquil Dreams. Jikkyu tried to force the pass in the mountains but we were ready for him and defeated him in a close-run battle. The south is liberated and the road to Iga is open. Your Grandmaster has sent a monk, Gorobei, to meet you.’[/p][p]He signals to his retainers who usher the monk in. You recognise the tall, powerful frame of Gorobei from the Temple of the Rock. He greets you and you embrace each other. ‘It is good to see you again, Avenger,’ he says, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. ‘Long have we prayed for you. We shall travel to Iga tomorrow and take ship homeward.’ He smiles happily. Kiyamo says, ‘You may rest here as my honoured guest tonight. The guest house has been prepared for you. My Bannerman, Hatemoto Hizen and six Samurai shall be your Honour Guard.’ You take your leave of Kiyamo and Gorobei and follow Hizen.[/p][p][link target='1038'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

The Sack of the South is escorted by three galleys of the type used by the northern barbarians for coastal raids. The barbarians do not use slaves as rowers; they row from the open deck, shaded from the sun by their shields, which line the ship’s rail. The weather is good and you sail west, away from the fjords of the Great Valley Reaches, then south, past Wargrave Abbas. As you sail past the city of Doomover you espy five flags on the horizon. Five rakish war-galleys begin to overhaul you. They fly the flag of the League of the Barbican, the war fleet of Doomover, and you know that they are manned by soldiers of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, worshippers of Vasch-Ro the wargod. They were once commanded by Honoric, whom you slew in Quench-heart Keep. The three barbarian galleys turn away to the open sea, mysteriously leaving the Sack of the South to her fate.

It has a strong mercenary tradition; young men and women come from lands far away to learn the skills of swordplay, taught by the worshippers of Dama, Shieldmaiden of the gods. Dama stands opposite the evil wargod, Vasch-Ro, in the Garden of the gods, and it was she whom Honoric, the Captain of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, sought to imprison in Inferno when he undertook his journey towards the Pillars of Change with Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame. Wargrave is also a thriving trading port, exporting grain and wool to southern lands. One thing only strikes a sour note – the assassins who revere Torremalku the Slayer have long had a guild where anyone may go to put a price on the head of an innocent man. The worshippers of Torremalku, ‘Swift-sure bringer of death to beggar and king’, care nothing for life or for death, only for the artistry with which they kill. They pride themselves that few who are brought to their attention live for long, if the price is right.

The temple to Kwon nestles beneath it, its darkest vaults deep within its confines. Before the tiger-head doors stands the Grandmaster of the Dawn.

The Grandmaster says, ‘The temple is to lose its most powerful protector.’ You start and lay your hand upon his, but he continues, ‘Not I, not I, it is you, Avenger, who must leave us once more.’ You are about to protest but you cannot shirk your destiny so you wait to hear the Grandmaster’s revelations.

Your father was called Loremaster Szeged and he was Overlord of a great city in the Manmarch, Irsmuncast, the last stronghold of men before the Rift, which men call the Bowels of Orb. He was one of the wise synod, the Loremasters of Serakub, but he became a missionary carrying the word of Kwon the Redeemer into the Manmarch. He became the High Priest at the Temple to Kwon in Irsmuncast and in time through his wisdom and fair-mindedness he became King. He ruled benignly and well and was beloved of all, save the reverencers of Nemesis, the Supreme Principle of Evil and the riff-raff of thieves and cut-throats that gather in any great city. But when the monks of the Scarlet Mantis wished to build a temple to Vile beside the Temple of Avatar the One your father opposed this. He was a great martial arts warrior but he met his match and died at the hands of Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame. So I named you aptly, Avenger, for you have already avenged your father’s death, but now you must take back the crown, which is rightfully yours.

It becomes obvious to you that he is passionately interested in theology and, on one occasion, as you twist your head to look at him, you catch a look of pure zeal in his eyes that is frightening in its intensity.

As you draw closer you see that his eyes are closed in silent meditation. A long spear with a curved blade, a Naginata, lies at his side. He is covered in a large scarlet robe, so that his hands are hidden. As you approach he opens his eyes and looks up at you with a smile of greeting. His face is almost square, the neck thick with muscle. A pair of green eyes seem to sparkle with malicious humour. He stands up and nods at you. Then he slings off his robe, revealing the bright red loose jacket and trousers of a Monk of the Scarlet Mantis, the followers of Vile. You step back, readying yourself for combat, but the monk just smiles. A leather belt, holding several daggers, runs across his chest. An unusually shaped short bow hangs at his back and a quiver of ten brightly feathered arrows hangs at his side. He speaks, a rasping, gravely sound. ‘Welcome Avenger. We of the Scarlet Mantis have heard you were abroad on the Manmarch again. I had hoped you would come this way. You have incurred the wrath of some very powerful people and, eh, certain divine beings. It is time that the death of our Grandmaster, Yaemon, was avenged and that the wrongs you have perpetrated against the great god Vile, Insuperable Master of Unarmed Combat and Speaker of Unholy Words, are righted. This requires, of course, your death. So, I, Aiguchi the Weaponmaster, known to some as the Dagger, will finish you. However, we shall not fall to blows here and now, like common peasants. Besides, you could escape me too easily. No, we shall fight a duel! Have you heard of the Ring of Vasch-Ro. Ninja? No? Well it lies just beyond the next rise and it is an arena, maintained by Legionnaires of the Sword of Doom, where duels of honour are fought.’ He pauses for a moment, and then in ringing tones he says, ‘Avenger, I challenge you, and I invoke the power of Fate in the Ring of Vasch-Ro.’ A moment’s silence seems to fall all around as if he had indeed invoked some kind of power. ‘I shall prove to you, in the Ring, Ninja, how Kwon is as nothing in the face of the teachings of Vile.’[/p][p]Will you [link target='2070']accept the challenge of Aiguchi[/link] or [link target='2025']decide that you cannot afford to take unnecessary risks and continue on your way[/link]?[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]You wend your way through the cemetery to the tomb of Lord Kalmon. You pass through the ornately carved portals of the entrance into the darkness below. You draw out a torch and light it. It splutters into flame, filling the tomb with a flickering red glow, illuminating the single sarcophagus in the centre of the ancient chamber. You walk to the wall beyond the sarcophagus and pull at the wrought-iron torch bracket. There is a low rumble and a section of the wall slides open. The mechanism is well-oiled and the wall is free of dust. This entrance has been used recently – perhaps even regularly. Beyond the opening a flight of rough hewn steps lead downwards into darkness. You come out into a corridor, cold flagstones line the floor and as you walk around, the light from your torch, like a moving globe of luminescence, reveals painted murals on the walls.

It is the work of only a few minutes to loosen your bonds, and you trick the guard into coming close to the bars and then reach through them, grabbing his hair and cracking his head on the iron so that he falls unconscious.

The High Grandmaster tells you that the dungeon the soothsayer spoke of leads directly into the Throne Room and you agree that it will provide an ideal route of attack against the unsuspecting Usurper. The Grandmaster cautions you that men tell awful tales of horrors that lurk below the Palace, but that he knows of a secret way into the dungeons. If you search out the tomb of the long dead Lord Kalmon in the cemetery and pull down on the torch bracket that lights his epitaph, a doorway will open in the tomb. He has another piece of help for you; one of the soothsayers from the green has given him a message. It seems that the mausoleum of a former Lord of Irsmuncast holds a circlet, which holds a potent magic against the Usurper. You tell the High Grandmaster that the signal for the monks to attack will be the lowering of the Usurper’s flag on the Palace. When all of your preparations are complete you retire to meditate and then sleep. In the morning you walk, alone, towards the cemetery, dwelling on the High Grandmaster’s last words to you. ‘Farewell and remember Avenger, many before have tried to kill the Usurper and failed.

      <Text>[p]For some reason you find yourself dreaming of a great city, which you have never visited but is clear in every detail in your dream. It is as if you are hovering above it on a clear night. The wide avenues are lined with magical lamps in which orange flames flicker, casting a dull brown glow over the canopy of the night sky. It is a city of great domes and spires and at its centre one great towered dome larger than any building you have ever set eyes upon. You fly beyond it, like a night owl, to a magnificent spired palace, through jewelled gates and through huge rooms lined with velvet, halls with crystal chandeliers and up wide marble staircases. A macabre sense of witless purpose grips you, forcing you onto the top of the central spire, the master bedroom. But your dream does not take you through the great doors of solid gold that bar entrance to the chamber, you have already found the object of your quest. Arms akimbo beside the doors stands a towering figure, seven feet tall. It is naked but those parts, which would determine its sex, are missing, there is just a scar there. The face and head are a man’s but do not appear to fit the neck. It is a Golem, the parts of many dead bodies stitched together and reanimated magically. The personal bodyguard of Dom the Prescient, ruler of the Spires of Foreshadowing. As you watch in your mind’s eye, the unnatural monster opens its eyes and speaks in a cracked voice long disused, ‘Avenger!’ As you watch in your nightmare the Golem of Flesh takes a ponderous step towards the staircase.

You point them out and Glaivas says, ‘The Forest-Sprites, they are mischief makers and sometimes worse, but I had hoped they might help us.

      <Text>[p][script]player.visitedRiverOfBeasts = true;[/script]The inn called the River of Beasts is on a crooked line of flagstones called Izvestia Street. The sign outside it shows a sea serpent and grotesque snake-like horses and dogs frolicking in a frothing blue river. Inside you walk past two armed guards into a number of small rooms, each served by bars in which more than two hundred people are drinking and talking. The air is heavy with smoke and this is the first time that you have seen the common people of Irsmuncast appearing to enjoy themselves. You soon realise that you are being watched by the barman, so you sit quietly in a corner. A young serving boy gives you a drink by mistake and then gets cuffed round the head for his error by a hearty looking red-bearded fellow. You offer him the stirrup cup but he motions you to keep it, so you drink slowly and keep your eyes open. It soon becomes obvious that the people speak openly here about their hatred of the Usurper and you ask Red-beard about the people’s feelings. All that he tells you convinces you that, given a leader, someone to fight for, the rabble could rise up to throw off the yoke of tyranny. At least half of the able-bodied populace appear to have a burning grievance against the Usurper and in recent riots the soldiers, mainly orcs, had to kill many of them to quell their revolutionary ardour. You say nothing of your own right to the throne but ask why they have no leaders. Red-beard tells you that they have a leader, the Demagogue, but that while he is a fine mob-orator no-one would fight for him – he is hardly a dashing warrior. You ask him who he would like to ally himself with, the merchants, the priests of Time, or the swordswomen of Dama, but he replies that the commoners need no allies. At length you decide to leave, much heartened by your talk with Red-beard and his friends.[/p][p][link target='2006'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Below lies a low-roofed stone building in a cultivated field. Beyond it can be seen a small but thick wood. As you draw nearer, a group of men you recognise as soldiers from the Legion of the Sword of Doom, of Doomover, step out of the house. However, they do not seem to be looking for trouble. One of them, a sharp quick man with brown eyes and curly brown hair says ‘Welcome, once again Aiguchi – do you require the services of the Ring?’ ‘Yes Maak, I do. Allow me to introduce my latest opponent,’ and he indicates you. ‘This is the Ninja, Avenger, the one who slew Yaemon, Manse the Deathmage and almost, your own leader, Honoric.’ The others stare at you with fear and hatred in their eyes. ‘I hope you slay him, for we can do nothing while he competes in the Ring,’ says Maak. Aiguchi walks on towards the woods accompanied by two legionnaires. Then Maak steps forward and says, ‘Come then, I shall explain the rules of the Ring of Vasch-Ro,’ and he hands you a map of the Ring, old and worn by the hands of many combatants. Maak goes on, ‘In ages past a Covenant was made between Vasch-Ro, the Wargod and Fate, Keeper of the Balance. Fate will turn her back on anyone who refuses the challenge of the Ring or crosses the Fatestones, the boundary of the Ring, before the contest is over. Let us begin.’[/p][p]You are led to the wood ahead until you come to a stone gateway in its midst. Evenly spaced white stones stretch away to left and right. Maak says, ‘This is the Victim’s Gate, where you shall enter the Ring,’ and he chuckles evilly. ‘Aiguchi will be entering through the Victor’s Gate. We shall be waiting to greet the winner who must exit the Ring from the Victor’s Gate. Those white stones are the Fatestones, cross them at your peril. Well, I wish you ill-fortune, Avenger. May your bones rot for ever in the Ring.’ With that he leaves you alone to contemplate the weather-worn stone blocks that form the Victim’s Gate. You step forward into the Ring, ready to do battle once more with a monk of the Scarlet Mantis, who is somewhere within. A path disappears into the wood ahead of you.

Soon you are hidden in the shadows of the tunnel looking into a large square room carved out of the rock. In its centre stands a large fire, smoke billowing up to be lost in the darkness above. Around it are arranged two long oak tables, strewn with all kinds of food and drink, mostly meat, half raw and half eaten. At the tables sit three hulking beasts dressed in greasy leather armour, with large wooden clubs at their side. They are gross and misshapen, their skin a greyish-green colour, warty and mottled. Their fat faces have wide splayed nostrils and rotting teeth. Their huge beards are matted with filth. You recognise them as Cave Trolls. What interests you most is the blackened and stained livery they are wearing, for it is the stag with the spiral-horned antlers, the symbol of the Usurper. It seems these Cave Trolls are in his service, kept out of harm’s way down here but ready to be called upon if necessary.

There are no slaves using it for shelter, so Glaivas takes the opportunity to tell you of the Spectral Company. They are nine, each was once a Baron, lord of many men. They came from the city of Greydawn and worshipped the god of Empire, Moraine. They were the nine generals who led the men of Greydawn in search of Empire, on a quest to conquer the Valley of the Lich-Kings, which in those days was called the Valley of Grain. The Fleshless King was newly returned from the dead and, still active those centuries ago, he rode at the head of his troops. The power of his magic cast down the generals and he took them to be his servants, killing them and bringing their tormented bodies back to life. Now, in the form of spectres, which can suck a man’s life from him with a touch, they cow everyone in the valley. Their leader, Ganarre, is a powerful sorcerer, the Fleshless King’s brother, differing from him only in that his body has retained its cloak of flesh and the fact that part of his brain festered many centuries ago.[/p][p][link target='2115'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

You can clearly see Force-Lady Gwyneth on a grey warhorse apparently inspecting her troops. They are arranged in serried ranks on the parade ground beyond Cross street. The majority are women dressed in chain-mail but a sizeable number of men, too, carry the lozenge-shaped shields of Dama. A few are in full plate armour, their faces hidden behind visors. A small detachment of halvorcs and men bearing the Usurper’s stag emblem slouch nearby, at ease. Gwyneth’s lieutenant points up at you and the trumpeter sounds five short notes. Gwyneth shouts a command and the shieldmaidens divide into two, half marching towards the Palace and half towards the army barracks. The detachment of halvorcs and men react slowly, many have fallen to quick sword thrusts before they realise that the revolt has begun. Then they flee. The skill at arms of Gwyneth’s warriors is a joy to behold as they meet the Usurper’s men in open battle on the streets below. They are reinforced by the monks of Kwon and for some time the fighting sways back and forth, but the warrior-women are outnumbered and their advance is halted before the Palace gates. Looking down to Cross Street you can see that the barracks is holding out and a group of Priests are leaving the temple to Nemesis, marching to the relief of the army.

      <Text>[p]Hoping that the nervous structure of these creatures is not too different from that of a human, you wait for an opportunity to deliver a nerve-strike. The huge Troll swings its club in an arc aimed at your head. You duck under the ponderous blow and the club slams into the tunnel wall with a reverberating thud. You leap up and drive the ball of your foot at the beast’s throat with unerring accuracy. The Cave Troll coughs in agony and, dropping its club, staggers back, its massive meaty hands clawing at its thick throat. Abruptly it sits down and rolls about tile floor of the cavern, wracked with pain, shrieking and wailing, eyeing you fearfully. It seems basically uninjured, simply in great pain. At the sight of the biggest amongst them incapacitated by a single blow, the other two back away from you. Smiling to yourself at their bullying, cowardly nature, you turn your back on them and move on down the tunnel.[/p][p][link target='2162'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

The root has freed your mind from the ties of belief, which bind it to your body and your spirit flies free. You feel yourself floating gently upwards and below you can see Glaivas and the top of your own head, but Glaivas cannot see you. He starts as a dark shape begins to take the place of the swirling leaves, but your spirit is borne away suddenly by a gust of ethereal wind. In sudden panic you realise that you can hardly help yourself here on the spirit plane, but you dimly sense pathways stretching through the ether. The dark shape looms behind you. The beast, whatever it is, has managed to follow you onto the spirit plane. The wind whirls you towards a parting of ways and something tells you that the right-hand path leads towards the gates of Heaven, whilst the left leads towards the Elysian Fields.[/p][p]You struggle to take one of the paths, will you [link target='2295']take the right path[/link] or [link target='2302']the left[/link]?[/p]</Text>

He has devoted his entire life to the persecution of evil and he has only those possessions, which he needs to realise his goal, the rest of his spoils he gives to the poor. His god is Rocheval Prince of Knights Errant, wielder of the Holy of Holies. Legend has it that Rocheval was once a Paladin, a mortal who won the favour of Eo whilst campaigning in the Abyss. So heroic and pure was he that he became a god, an enduring example to those who fight Evil and Chaos.

      <Text>[p]With a flash of insight, you remember that the brass signet ring also depicts a hippogriff and that it is just the right size to fit into the depression. You take it out and place it into the hole. It fits perfectly. Suddenly there is a loud click and a grinding sound and the slab in front of you begins to sink into the ground. Bright light floods out from the room beyond. Walking through the secret entrance, you find yourself in a large circular chamber. Immediately before you on the ground is a stone slab, the resting place of a long-dead Lord of Irsmuncast. In the centre of the room stands a marble plinth upon which rests a thin gold circlet. It is adorned with a single sparkling ruby that glitters in the light. This must be the item you were told would be of use against the Usurper. The plinth is surrounded by a ring of flames. You cannot discern what the flames are feeding off – indeed there is something very odd about the fire. It gives off a bright white light and the flames flicker and burn about an inch off the ground. The flames are a coppery yellow and seem insubstantial in some way. Stepping closer you pass your hand through the flame. An agonising pain fills your soul for an instant, burning at the core of your being. You realise that these are not physical flames but ethereal flames and that they would not leave your clothes and skin charred and blackened but your very soul itself.

      <Text>[p]The High Grandmaster is an old man, his watery eyes hold wisdom but he has lost the strength of his body. You show him your father’s seal, the hippogriff on the chequerboard and the birthmark. He hails you as a deliverer from the evil tyranny of the Usurper – it is plain that he feels his own weakness and inability to oppose the despot keenly. You talk far into the night and he tells you how things stand in the city of Irsmuncast nigh Edge.[/p][p]Since your father, the Loremaster’s death the cruel Usurper has tyrannised the people, killing all who oppose him and grinding the spirit of the peasants underfoot. The farmers have had their land taken away from them, now they are bond-slaves, tied to the land, forced to give a half of everything they grow to feed the Usurper’s army of orcs and halvorcs. To be married, couples must gain a permit from the Usurper’s Lord Steward. Worshippers of Avatar and Kwon are often refused this and so cannot have legitimate children. Bastards can never inherit. Crippling taxes have been imposed on all save those who worship Nemesis. This means that people are forced to renounce their belief and turn to evil if they are to be anything but miserably poor. The priests of Nemesis and the Usurper’s army rule with naked swords but they cannot close the temples. ‘The temple tax is high’, says the Grandmaster. ‘We cannot pay our due, but even the Usurper cannot turn us out. We have no power but that over people’s minds.’[/p][p]You explain that you have come to take your rightful throne and he pledges the support of the Temple, but says that it will not be enough to kill the tyrant, there must be a revolution to overturn the army and the priests of Nemesis. The martial arts tradition of the Temple to Kwon is not strong so you will have to seek support for the revolution elsewhere before you slay the Usurper.[/p][p][link target='2172'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

He adds that the merchants keep a large number of mercenary soldiers in their pay. You are escorted from the green by two evil-looking mercenaries in purple livery. Golspiel has just completed the auction of some jewellery when you find him in his emporium which is a great purple pavilion furnished with exotica from far away lands. His eyes are like small shining currants in a face that shudders every time he moves. His fat jowls hang down like dewlaps and his hands look like balloons. He smiles and asks in a smooth persuasive voice what your business is. You tell him straight away who you are, showing him your father’s hippogriff and chequerboard seal and your birthmark. He is sceptical at first, but something about you convinces him that your father was indeed the Loremaster. Then you tell him that you are fated to overthrow the Usurper and become Overlord in his place, asking for Golspiel’s support in the revolution. The merchant gives nothing away but he begins to persuade you that you must lift all taxes on the traders when you are Overlord and suggests that all those desiring to become merchants should apply to him for a certificate allowing them to trade.[/p][p]Will you [link target='2176']tell him that you will give these concessions in return for his support[/link] or [link target='2168']say that you will give these things thought but it is too soon to make such promises[/link]?[/p]</Text>

You put your hand on the door-handle and turn it experimentally. It is unlocked and you swing it open and step into a richly furnished room, the walls of which are lined with shelves packed with scrolls and books. Behind a large ornately carved desk sits a strange figure, looking up in surprise as you come in with eyes that are completely white, save for the pupils, two pin-points of blackness. Its face is hideous, it is totally bald, the skin a pale blotchy colour. Below the flat nostrils of its boneless nose, five tentacles each about a foot in length writhe horribly. Just below these is the mouth, small and circular with sharp pointed teeth. It wears purple robes edged with gold and there is an ancient tome open on the desk in front of it. Its hands end in three long, thin tentacles, in place of fingers. You recognise it from ancient books and drawings as an Old One, a race of creatures that inhabit the depth of the Rift. Utterly evil and said to be schemers and ultimate leaders, other than the gods, of much that is evil on Orb. The Old One stands slowly and speaks in a sibilant whispering voice, ‘This is indeed an unexpected pleasure! Welcome! Welcome! You must be Avenger, the, er… “rightful” heir to the throne of Irsmuncast, I have heard a lot about you, Ninja. The Usurper and I hoped you would not get this far, but it appears you are more resourceful than we had imagined. Still it does mean the pleasure of your annihilation shall be all mine.’ Suddenly your mind is assailed by a blast of mental energy and you realise the Old One is launching a psychic attack against you. You feel your will literally beginning to shred under the awesome power of the creature’s mind. You find yourself virtually unable to move, your mind locked in a deadly battle of wills.

      <Text>[p]You unwind your hood and take a sleeveless white homespun jacket from your bag of Ninja tools. To complete your preparations for entering the city, you take off your shoes – the rightful Overlord of Irsmuncast will enter the city humbly, barefoot. The city is set amongst rich farmlands and meadows in which grow the various plants giving rise to colourful dyes. Irsmuncast is famed throughout the Manmarch for its weaving and dyeing, for carpets, pavilions and tapestry making. It is a fair seeming city, its walls made of a dull red stone with towers at fifty-foot intervals along the battlements. As you walk through the fields you can see that its citizens are of many types, some flaxen-haired, others with flashing black eyes and raven hair. You are surprised to see that many of the peasants have a coarse-limbed orcish look about them, some have the noseless faces of halvorcs. The Great South Gate is a triumphal arch, topped by two squat towers with a raised portcullis at front and back. The inscription on the arch reads ‘In memory of the great victories won by the people of Irsmuncast against the Dark Forces from the Edge’. The gateguard are alert and number ten noseless men, probably halvorcs, under the command of a priest bearing the whirlpool symbol of Nemesis on his black robes. It seems a strong guard for a city, which is not at war. You wait for the influx of peasants at dusk and slip into the city unnoticed at the changing of the guard.[/p][p][link target='2244'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

He darts nervous looks out of the side of his eyes every now and then, but his behaviour is not that of one who feels outcast from society, rather it shows that he fears being found out for what he is. Your ShinRen tells you that this is an opportunity to find out more, which should not be missed. As you pass a dark doorway you stun him with a deft chop to the back of the neck and drag him into the shadows. As he comes round you slip your Garotte around his neck and tighten it. You can tell he is lying when he says he is a robber and at last he tells you that he is a member of the Tyrant’s secret informers, responsible for ferreting out all those opposed to the rule of the Usurper. He shows you the yellow mark near his elbow which is carried by all of the Tyrant’s informers and warns you that they are always to be found in at least two of the larger inns, the Cleansing Flame, frequented solely by followers of Nemesis, and the Hostel from the Edge, where most strangers to the city finish up. When he has told you how to get to the Temple you tighten the wire. He knows too much. His body will not be found till dawn and you hurry back to the green then turn east.

Glaivas pulls the bolt from your flesh, leaving a gaping wound. The signs of poison on the bolt are plain to him and he takes a piece of waxed paper from a pouch, but you tell him he need not concern himself with the poison. ‘So the tales they tell of the Ninja are true,’ he says, smiling. You reply that there are many secrets unknown about the Ninja as well. Glaivas seems about to say something but takes a bone-needle threaded with horse hair from his belt instead and, after saying a spell of healing, stitches up your wound.

They are powerful to be sure, but did they do anything when the Loremaster was murdered by that monk?

      <Text>[p]Your keen senses, honed to perfection by years of training, enable you to pick out slight discolouration on the far wall. Examining it closely you find a small opening in line with the small depression in the middle of the door-like slab. Carefully, you probe the hippogriff-decorated depression with your fingers. Suddenly there is a click, but, forewarned, you throw yourself to the floor immediately. A crossbow bolt flies from the opposite wall to shatter against the stone slab where your back was an instant ago. Then there is a grinding sound and the door-like slab begins to sink into the ground. Bright light floods out from the room beyond. Walking through the secret entrance, you find yourself in a large circular chamber. Immediately before you on the ground is a stone slab, the resting place of a long-dead Lord of Irsmuncast. In the centre of the room stands a marble plinth upon which rests a thin gold circlet. It is adorned with a single sparkling ruby that glitters in the light. This must be the item you were told would be of use against the Usurper. The plinth is surrounded by a ring of flames. You cannot discern what the flames are feeding off – indeed there is something very odd about the fire. It gives off a bright white light and the flames flicker and burn about an inch off the ground. They are a coppery-yellow and seem insubstantial in some way. Stepping closer you pass your hand through the flame. An agonising pain fills your soul for an instant, burning at the core of your being.

      <Text>[p]After many weeks your new training is over and the Grandmaster of the Dawn summons you to the Temple. In the meditation room you let your spirits roam free together and your mind is wafted away by the ethereal wind. The Grandmaster travels with you and, to your surprise, you see that his ethereal form is that of a smiling young woman, crowned with a halo of burning silver. He leads you onward, you grasp the milk-white, smooth-skinned hand and hold on tightly, knowing that without the Grandmaster’s guidance you would drift helplessly; the skills of the ninja cannot aid you here. The Grandmaster of the Dawn points ahead to a gleaming archway beyond which a silver pathway stretches up into the clouds. Cherubs flock around its pillars and a Guardian Angel, flawless and white, stands between them. ‘This is the Gateway to the Seven Heavens,’ says the Grandmaster. ‘We may not enter yet.’ As he speaks, a sinuous form takes shape on the silver road. It glides past the Guardian Angel and as it approaches, you see that it is a perfect tiger, but her fur is white and her eyes are blue. The Spirit Tiger is a servant of Kwon and as she looks at you she passes on a part of her knowledge in the form of a warning. The Evil gods are angry and in your struggle against the Usurper, Kwon may not help you. You must triumph through your own sagacity and strength of hand.[/p][p]Just as the Spirit Tiger is turning away, she pauses to look into your eyes and you hear her voice in your mind, ‘Although the Great Redeemer will not aid you directly, I am his servant and I will strive to protect you from the malice of the gods of Evil for they are summoning fell creatures from the lower planes to thwart you.’ With that she is gone and you are swept up in the ethereal wind, returning at last to the Temple where your mind rejoins your body.[/p][p][link target='2080'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Your resourcefulness is rewarded, the snare tightens around his ankle and the bent pine tree whips upright, pulling him off his feet.

      <Text>[p]As quick as thought, you throw yourself to the ground. Glaivas has done the same, and a crossbow quarrel embeds itself in the ground beside you. Glaivas is on his feet and sprinting around behind the hill immediately. You pick up the bolt and run up the other side of the hill, but meet Glaivas at the summit without having glimpsed your unknown enemy. The crossbow bolt is grooved and there is poison on it. The assassins are at work again. Glaivas suggests once more that you turn north towards the Forest of Arkadan and says that if you wish to travel through the Valley of the Lich-Kings along the highway you can do so without his help.[/p][p]Will you [link target='2111']turn north with Glaivas[/link] or [link target='2136']journey on along the road alone[/link]?[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]You try to scale the walls of the pit, but you cannot get a good hold in the soft earth. You have no choice but to take out the rods of iron from the sleeves of your costume and drive them deep into the walls, using them like pitons to climb out of the pit. Eventually you are standing at its top. However, you have been forced to leave the iron rods in the pit. You are unable to block any weapon attacks until you can get some more rods made up.[script]context.removeItem(player, 'ironSleeves');[/script] Bright light floods out from the now opened stone door ahead of you and you step through it to find yourself in a large circular chamber. Immediately before you on the ground is a stone slab, the resting place of a long-dead Lord of Irsmuncast. In the centre of the room stands a marble plinth upon which rests a thin gold circlet. It is adorned with a single sparkling ruby that glitters in the light. This must be the item you were told would be of use against the Usurper. The plinth is surrounded by a ring of flames. You cannot discern what the flames are feeding off – indeed there is something very odd about the fire. It gives off a bright white light and the flames flicker and burn about an inch off the ground. They are a coppery-yellow and seem insubstantial in some way. Stepping closer you pass your hand through the flame. An agonising pain fills your soul for an instant, burning at the core of your being. You realise that these are not physical flames but ethereal flames and that they would not leave your clothes and skin charred and blackened, but your very soul itself.

      <Text>[p]As Honoric falls back past the rhododendrons and behind a plane tree you notice that he has just missed stepping in a snare trap. If you allow him to catch his breath and lure him to attack you again, you judge that he may be caught in the trap. You wait and as he advances the snare tightens around his ankle and a bent bough of the plane tree snaps upright, pulling him off his feet. He hangs upside down before your face, the trapper’s snare dangling him from the tree, but he hasn’t lost his presence of mind. ‘Bear me aloft, Sorcerak,’ he shouts, and his body floats out of your reach, he hangs grimly on to the hilt of his sword, which pulls him into the topmost leaves of the tree. A leather pouch falls from his belt, which you scoop up quickly as you hear the sound of many hooves cresting a hill nearby. It is a strong party of the Legion of the Sword of Doom. You decide to make good your escape while you can as Honoric blusters furiously, ‘You mock me Fate, it was not destined to end like this!’ but his cries are soon far behind you and his men try to calm him down.

The Fiend’s face creases in feral rage as it realises it has been denied its quarry even at the instant of the kill. The magnificent Spirit Tiger, flawless and powerful, launches herself at the grisly Fiend and a bloody battle begins. The usually calm Spirit Tiger bites and rakes her claws at the Fiend with bestial ferocity although her head is belaboured by crushing blows from the arms of horn. At last the Fiend from the Pit realises that death is about to take it. The horns score deep furrows down the Spirit Tiger’s flank but her jaws finally meet in the Fiend’s neck.

You can clearly see Force-Lady Gwyneth on a grey warhorse, apparently inspecting her troops. They are ranged in serried ranks on the parade ground beyond Cross Street. The majority are women dressed in chain-mail but a sizable number of men, too, carry the lozenge-shaped shields of Dama. A few are in full plate armour, their faces hidden behind visors. A small detachment of halvorcs and men bearing the Usurper’s stag emblem slouch nearby, at ease. Gwyneth’s lieutenant points up at you and the trumpeter sounds five short notes. Gwyneth shouts a command and the shieldmaidens divide into two, half marching towards the Palace and half towards the army barracks. The detachment of halvorcs and men react slowly, many have fallen to quick sword thrusts before they realise that the revolt has begun. Then they flee. The skill at arms of Gwyneth’s warriors is a joy to behold as they meet the Usurper’s men in open battle on the streets below. They are reinforced by the monks of Kwon and for some time the fighting sways back and forth, but the warrior-women are outnumbered and their advance is halted before the Palace gates. Looking down to Cross Street you can see that the barracks is holding out and a group of priests are leaving the Temple to Nemesis, marching to the relief of the army. The battle hangs in the balance. There is nothing you can do but watch. It would be foolish to fight your way out through the Palace. Suddenly, as if from nowhere, a horde of people appear around the priests of Nemesis. The mob has risen, armed themselves with short swords, axes and clubs. The spells of the priests kill many of the crowd but they are forced to retire inside the Temple. The word spreads like wildfire through the city and the streets become thronged with people.

You are blown this way and that, seemingly at random, until a gleaming archway shimmers before you, a silver pathway beyond it stretches up into the white clouds. Behind you a dark cloud gathers and takes the shape of the Fiend from the Pit, It can travel the byways of the ether as easily as you can walk down a flagged road. Two cherubs fly towards you and lead you to the archway where a Guardian Angel stands as a sentinel, guarding the entrance to the Seven Heavens. The Guardian Angel bars your way, saying, ‘Your body breathes yet, you may not pass.’ Its expression becomes grim as the Fiend looms behind you. It wails like a banshee and the cherubs flee up the silver pathway beating their gossamer wings in panic, but the sentinel stands firm as the Fiend cries, ‘If I complete my task, robbing your body of life, your spirit shall gain eternal repose in Heaven. I had far rather you earned it. I give you your life, you may still waver from the straight and narrow path.’ With that it is gone. The Guardian Angel speaks one word, ‘Llandymion’, and before you realise what has happened your mind is flowing back into your body, which is sorely hurt.

You tell him of your unlooked-for new mission and he tells you, in return, what he knew of your father. ‘He was,’ he says, ‘not a man who sought greatness, but one who suffered greatness to be thrust upon him for the common good. He was a wise and popular ruler, enlightened, but no despot. Many in Irsmuncast still grieve for him.’ When he has told you all he knows of your father, the Loremaster, you say. ‘I asked you once, on your fair ship the Aquamarin, of the cities, which lie beyond Tor on the Greybones river, but you would not speak of them. I ask you again, only because I have chosen that course to approach the city of Irsmuncast without exciting suspicion.’ Glaivas sighs heavily and then asks you into his study, where a large bureau is full of valuable scroll-maps. He pins several out on a felt-topped table showing you new lands of which you have never heard. One shows a new continent named the Lands of No Return, another the Forest of Fables, another shows the islands beyond the clashing rocks called the Fangs of Nadir and yet another, Southern Lands. Glaivas gifts you another finely-crafted map showing the Greybones river, the Manmarch and Beyond the Rift. You notice that the position of the city Ulrik’s Haven has been changed on one of the maps.

      <Text>[p]He seems to know that you are a stranger to the city but he doesn’t ask you any questions. At last you are outside an inn with a sign-written board above the door – ‘The Hostel from the Edge’. You ask the tramp what it means and he tells you that the people of Irsmuncast call the Bowels of Orb or the Rift, the Edge. Inside is a huge low vault, filled with a hundred or more souls, only about half of whom are human. The balance are orcs, halvorcs and a group of dangerous looking wolfen, erect and arrogant looking. They have the heads of wolves and the bodies of beast men but they stand over seven feet tall. Peasant girls are carrying tankards to the customers seated at low tables and benches. The tramp shuffles away to get drunk so you decide to try to find out something about the city.[/p][p]Will you [link target='2054']talk to some nearby halvorcs[/link] or [link target='2033']sit alone and see if you overhear anything of interest[/link]?[/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]You wend your way between the debauched-looking customers to the low chess table and pretend to study a chess problem for a while. You have not been there long and conversation has started again, when a young man in a grey doublet and hose sits opposite you, pours two glasses of wine and offers to give you a game. Seeing this is an ideal opportunity to get to know someone who is not a peasant, you agree readily. He gives you white but you nevertheless play an uncharacteristically defensive pawn formation. ‘The shieldmaiden’s reserve,’ comments your opponent. ‘You are not, by any chance, a reverencer of Dama?’ You shake your head innocently, and a woman with plucked eyebrows and eye kohl on an adjoining chaise-longue laughs and says. ‘Thank the Dark-Lord for that! Their prowess with the sword is already too much without their beating us at the game of chess as well.’ Some of the soldiers howl at her but she waves her black lace fan at them, ‘Why then, can you not stop them drilling and parading as if it were they who ruled the city?’ This provokes a hostile outcry but the woman ignores it and attempts to hide herself in your game. Your opponent introduces himself as Radziwil and the woman is Elektra. They talk quietly for a time, not excluding you, of the bad feeling that exists for the Usurper within the city. At length Radziwil turns to you and says, ‘What do you think? Irsmuncast could do with a new ruler.’[/p][p]Will you [link target='2084']agree quietly but heartily and say that you know of a possible candidate[/link] or [link target='2098']say that Irsmuncast seems a fair and fine city[/link]?[/p]</Text>

The Usurper of Irsmuncast nigh Edge, a foul demon who was turning the city to evil, has been cast down by your own hand and now you must rule in his place.[/p][p]Weary but exultant, you climb to the topmost turret of the Palace to survey the city. Palace Walk, a wide avenue of lime trees, leads past the houses of the well-to-do to a grand crossroads with Cross Street. Here two buildings dwarf all others save the Palace itself. The brooding black pinnacles of the temple to Nemesis, the Supreme Principle of Evil, Lord of the Cleansing Flame, seem to claw rapaciously at the glowing sky. One of the many difficulties of your rule will be to keep the templars of Nemesis in check.[br /]Equally imposing is the great, grey fortress pyramid that is the Temple to Dama, shieldmaiden of the gods. The warrior women who serve it were valiant lawkeepers under the rule of your father, Loremaster Szeged. Smaller than these and opposite the black pinnacles is the white stone Temple to Avatar, Supreme Principle of Good. A great white torch flares atop the spire’s cross in your honour.[/p][p]In the distance to the south is the area of blackness which denotes the park where lies the temple to your own god, Kwon the Redeemer. Nearby are the many coloured lights of the merchants’ quarter. The people in the streets who rose up under the urging of the Demagogue, their leader, to throw off the Usurper’s yoke are still chanting your name as you turn to the west, where all is strangely quiet. The huge Temple to Time stands dark against the stillness and the inscrutable priests of that most powerful of gods show no sign either of welcome or rejection. How much time will be vouchsafed you to rule over Irsmuncast nigh Edge, the last bastion of men before the Rift? Irsmuncast holds back the black tide, which threatens to swamp the lands of men.[/p][p]The east side of the city is named the Edgeside. The city wall here is taller than at any other point because it faces the Rift – the Bowels of Orb – from which nameless evil issues forth to pollute Orb. You must play your part in keeping this evil in check. Your exultation fades as weariness overcomes you. In the morning you must be Overlord.

Although the bed is decked with sable furs and satin sheets, the walls are hung with paintings of souls in torment. Ordering the beautiful handmaiden who brings you balm to turn these to the wall, you sink gratefully into the furs. The High Grandmaster of the Temple to Kwon himself will sleep in the antechamber and his monks will stand guard outside your door. Drifting into slumber you think back to the crowning ceremony. Keeping your composure had taxed you sorely after the terrible struggle with the Usurper and his minions, summoned from the depths of the abyss. The coming of the mightiest people of the city to do obeisance before you seems little more than a dream, but tomorrow you begin the trials of your reign in earnest.[/p][p][link target='3011'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]The first day of the month of Harvest Bounty dawns fine. You awake refreshed and the dark and graceful Palace handmaidens, evidently chosen by the Usurper or his Lord High Steward for their beauty, assist you to bathe and dress. They wait on you hand and foot but you cannot tell if their murmured admiration of your toned body is genuine or mere sycophantic toadying. You breakfast alone with Parsifal, the High Grandmaster of the Temple to Kwon, who explains that the customs ordained by your father, the Loremaster, for his successor dictate the order of happenings on this, your first full day as Overlord of Irsmuncast. The Loremaster did not, of course, rule unaided; he depended on four advisers who sat with him in the Privy Council of Star Chamber. Parsifal ends, ‘All those who wish to be considered for the posts of Privy Councillors of Star Chamber must present themselves before you in your Throne Room this very morning.’[/p][p]As you process solemnly towards the Throne Room, followed by the monks of Kwon and those few of the Usurper’s courtiers who have not fled, Parsifal explains the procedure: ‘All those who wish to be considered for the honour of being your personal advisers are waiting in the vestibule. Tradition demands that they be presented to you in the order in which they arrived. They will enter the Throne Room one by one and you, Your Majesty, shall decide whether they take a seat in the Star Chamber or leave the Palace in disappointment. Remember, only four may become Privy Councillors.’[/p][p][link target='3041'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]The Usurper’s Lord High Steward sweeps into the room like a great Blackhawk. His silver and sable cloak is topped by curving wings of black velvet at the shoulders. His face is pale and drawn with a long thin nose and a little grey goatee, which emphasises the length and point of his chin. He bows elaborately and says, ‘Your Majesty, I have been running this city since the death of your father. In that time we have suffered no attack from beyond the city walls. I know more about the problems of this city, its religions and races than any other. I am practised in statecraft and I am the representative of the Temple to Nemesis, without whose support your days as Overlord will be numbered. I give you my word that I will act in your best interest and not seek to supplant you. Our people deserve to be represented on the Privy Council like any other. And so I believe you must appoint me to Star Chamber.’[/p][p]He seems about to go on but checks himself. There is no missing the veiled threat in his manner. About three in ten of the beings in Irsmuncast worship Nemesis, the Supreme Principle of Evil. You must decide between pleasing them and the usefulness of the Steward and the potential danger of adding to his power.[/p][p][link target='3051']If you order the Lord High Steward into the Star Chamber[/link].[br /][link target='3061']If, instead, you disappoint him[/link].[/p]</Text>

Perhaps two hundred were slaughtered, including General Barkant, but they still number nigh on four thousand sword-arms: about a thousand Orcs, the same again of the noseless crossbreed Halvorcs, plus two thousand humans – almost all men.

On the one hand, they help to protect the city against raids from the Bowels of Orb so without them the city’s military defence strength will be weakened.

The Usurper’s troops, no longer paid, skulk around in the city, generally up to no good. Others seek work as mercenaries in far-away lands. When the rains come in the month of Demondim and the Spawn of the Rift launch a raid against the city, the walls are unmanned. The citizen militia, lacking any great skill at arms, are cut down in the streets one stormy night by an avalanching horde of Dark Elves and Cave Trolls.

It is Parsifal who addresses the council; ‘Majesty, tradition says that each of the five major Temples be taxed equally but for many years we have had to pay crippling taxes, whilst the Temple to Time paid none, and priests of Nemesis grew fat on the proceeds. We suggest, Your Majesty, that you fine the Temple to Nemesis five talents and levy a tax of one talent from the Temple to Time. When next you need taxes we may then return to the old system of equal tithing. In this way, Overlord, you may win the hearts of the people by undoing some of the wrongs done by the Usurper.’[/p][p]Gwyneth adds, ‘The people feel that the priests of Nemesis have escaped lightly under your rule. Punish them, Overlord.’[/p][p][link target='3007'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]The Lord High Steward smiles for once before beginning his speech, but the facial expression produced is so at variance with his cold stiff bearing that the desired effect is lost: ‘There are those within the city who say that we priests of Nemesis have grown fat on the taxes of other temples. It is not true. The Usurper took all and spent like a prodigal son. Money disappeared into the treasury coffers and was never seen again. We are ready to pay our equal tithe of tax in common with the other temples to Time, Dama, Avatar and Kwon – a talent from each temple. This will raise five talents of gold for the treasury. It also represents a fair basis for taxation, which will not prove unpopular.’ He sits down and looks at his fellow councillors from under hooded lids.[/p][p][link target='3007'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]Once again, Solstice does not deign to stand to address the council. He wraps his grey and white robes close about him before beginning: ‘The Temple to Time is like an island in this city, between the factions of good and evil, law and chaos. We ask for nothing and, traditionally, we give nothing, save of course for advice, which we hope will prove useful. It is thus appropriate that the Temple to Time should continue to be exempt from tax. As to the others I suggest a one-talent tax for the Temples to Dama, Kwon and Avatar, two talents for the priests of Nemesis who fared well under the Usurper’s rule. This I feel would help to return affairs in the city to a balanced state whilst also raising five talents in tax. I am sure Your Majesty appreciates the support of our priesthood and does not want to dispense with it.’ The old priest catches your eye and holds it, as if divining your thoughts.[/p][p][link target='3007'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Firstly, he suggests that the five main temples – to Kwon, Dama, Time, Avatar and Nemesis – be taxed at the rate of one talent each. In addition, he proposes the sale of Indulgences, a system whereby the Overlord bestows baronetcies and other honorary titles on people who are willing to pay for that honour and the favour of the Crown. He estimates that this will bring in a further two talents, meaning that you would collect seven talents overall. His arguments are persuasive and he points out that these measures should not prove unpopular, while raising a great deal of money.[/p][p][link target='3007'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

To your surprise he begins his speech by saying that the expenses of the Crown should be no more than three talents and he would raise this money, and some to spare, in the following way: a window tax, that is a tax on all those people who owned buildings with more than ten windows in them, he has calculated would raise a talent of gold from the rich. He also suggests a tax on all merchants with stalls or shops in the city, according to their size, which would raise a second talent. He then proposes a double tax on the Temple to Nemesis.

      <Text>[p]The Mountains of Undying Solitude loom before you, dark and forbidding, like gnarled fingers clawing blindly at the dirty grey sky. A cold biting wind that chills your bones strikes up as you move through the foothills. The black clouds, heavy and ponderous, empty themselves on the lifeless earth and great sheets of freezing rain and sleet buffet you as you struggle upward. It is as if the mountains themselves were trying to sweep you off their sides, just as a man would remove an insect that troubled him. The land is all but barren, a hostile land tortured by the elements, where few plants or animals, let alone men, can survive.[/p][p]As you climb, you come to some sparse vegetation, shrubs and bushes, blowing violently in the keening wind as if they struggled desperately against something that sought to tear them by the roots from the life-giving earth.

Water runs off your body in rivulets and it is not long before you are struggling inwards through a small rushing torrent as the rain cascades down the mountainside.

A great chasm opens up before you as if some god-like Titan had slashed the earth with his sword. Beyond it, and rising up into the sky, are the Crags of Abandoned Hope, crooked jumbles of stone, towering upward above the mountain like a crown. A thin stone bridge, about two feet wide, spans the chasm – of natural origin, not man-made. Up above you the mountain leans over and joins the massive expanse of forbidding stone on the other side.

      <Text>[p]The path leads up towards the forbidding Crags of Abandoned Hope. Soon it becomes little more than a series of footholds, which appear to be little used – or, at least, anything that has been this way has not left any tracks. At last, the torrential rain ceases and the sun peeks out from behind the clouds. However, the fresh bright light serves only to highlight the barren nature of these hills. After a time, the path widens into a small flattish clearing, directly below the three gnarled crags. Then you freeze in shocked surprise; by its edge ties a seemingly innocent rock, but carved into it is a Whirlpool symbol, the symbol of the god Nemesis – the god of the Ninja of the Way of the Scorpion. Your senses straining, you search the surrounding rocks intently. A feeling that someone – or something – is watching you becomes overwhelming.

Several galleys, triremes and biremes, are moored nearby. Some sails bear the symbol of a dancing sword, a tasselled scroll and an open hand beneath them – the symbol of Gauss the sage-god turned warrior-god. Others bear a pointed red cross on a white background, the symbol of the god Rocheval, lord of Paladins and Knights Errant. Warriors dressed in armoured breastplates, with greaves, round shields and crested helmets and bearing sixteen-foot pikes, patrol the harbour and man the city walls.[/p][p]As you disembark at the bustling quayside you notice something odd about the city. Right across every inch of the city’s rooftops and walls, protrude vicious spikes, a good five feet in length. Each tier of the city walls is crested with many towers. Each turret contains several guardsmen, surveying the skies but not the outlying grounds. They man enormous ballistae, great crossbow-like devices pointed at the sky. Stretching between the towers are massive rope-nets, so that the whole city is encased in netting. You can only assume the city suffers from some terrible threat from the skies.

The priests disappear back into the temple but the shining warriors surround their leader and his son. Paladin’s face is grim as he looks up, ‘Never have I seen so many at one time.’ Then the dragons dive towards the city and the tower ballistae open fire. Volleys of enormous spear-like arrows speed heavenward, searing off dragon scales or sinking into soft underbellies. The priests of Rocheval appear at the towers and on the temple roofs; lancing bolts of white fire flash from their hands into the midst of the dragon hosts and some dragons plummet earthward to be caught in the nets.[/p][p]‘To your posts,’ shouts Paladin, and his warriors run to the highest point of the city’s turrets. Then the dragons unleash a terrible assault on the city. Great spurts of flame burst from the mouths of the red dragons and rivers of acid erupt from the mouths of the black dragons.

Just before the massive blue dragon is about to hit the ground it whips out its wings and they fill the air with a crack.[br /]It hangs above Paladin, great eyes glaring in rage and anticipation. It speaks, its voice booming, resonant with evil. ‘At last,’ it says. Then a cracking bolt of lightning leaps from its jaws.

Only your powers of Endurance save you from drowning. Exhausted and half conscious, you are eventually washed up on a sandy beach. You lie there for an interminable period of time, too tired to move. When you have regained some strength, you look up to see a thick wall of vegetation stretching away to either side, a dense forest. Taking out your sodden map you guess it to be the Forest of Fables. If you head north-east, you should come out on the shore of the Elemental Sea and thus avoid the Fangs of Nadir completely, although even your heart quails at the thought of swimming across the Elemental Sea, for it is said to be impossibly perilous, even without a Kraken inhabiting its depths.

The wharves are lined with a milling crowd of sailors, cut-throats, villains and townsfolk – it is evident that the island’s main trade is piracy. Your tiny boat is virtually ignored and you leap onto the quayside. Instantly, the fishing boat turns and leaves, without a by-your-leave, its Captain eager to be away from this place.

You emerge to find yourself face to face with a large temple of ebon stone, its spider-like turrets and spires reaching heavenward in a seemingly random pattern. The enormous doors of lacquered red enamel are adorned with the symbol of a stylised spider, and priestesses dressed in red and black pass through it. Some of the buttresses are joined to the main building by arching spans of web, giving the impression that the whole place is but the abode of some great spider. You recognise a Temple to Nullaq, ‘She who rules in malicious envy’. As you stare at it, wondering how mankind could fall to worshipping such evil gods and goddesses, a commotion behind you causes you to turn. It is a priestess of Nullaq, obviously of high rank for she has a bodyguard of two eunuchs, both naked to the waist. They are tall and heavily muscled, the muscle also covered with much fat. They wield enormous scimitars.[/p][p]The little entourage emerge from the alley-way and continue on their way, past the common folk towards the temple. The priestess, in red and black, wears a strange head-dress of boiled leather, fashioned to look like the bloated body of a spider, a rather revolting sight. Your eye travels down the complicated array of robes to fix on that, which hangs on a gold chain around her neck. It is a pendant of onyx, gilded with diamonds, shaped like a squid, an Amulet of Nullaq. It is too open for you to attack them now and they pass into the temple.[/p][p]You need the Amulet.

Several galleys – triremes and biremes – are moored nearby. Some sails bear a symbol of a dancing sword, a tasselled scroll and an open hand beneath them – the symbol of Gauss the sage-god turned warrior god. Others bear the pointed red cross on a white background, the symbol of the god Rocheval, Lord of Paladin and Knights Errant. Warriors dressed in armoured breastplates with greaves, round shields and crested helmets, and bearing sixteen foot pikes, patrol the harbour and man the city walls.[/p][p]As you disembark at the bustling quayside you notice something odd about the city. Right across every inch of the city’s rooftops and walls, protrude vicious spikes, a good five feet in length. Each tier of the city walls is crested with many towers. Each turret contains several guardsmen, surveying the skies, not the outlying grounds. They man enormous ballistae, great crossbow-like devices pointed at the sky. Stretching between the towers are massive rope nets, so that the whole city is encased in netting. You can only assume the city suffers from some terrible threat from the skies.

It tears through the glutinous membrane, and a drop of greenish ichor wells up through the wound. The Kraken thrashes its tentacles in agony and you are sent flying through the air. You crash into the water, and when you come up you see the elvan boat intact, a few yards away from you. It is upside down, but, incredibly, it rights itself. You look around for the Kraken, but it is already sinking beneath the waves, returning to the watery depths to nurse its insignificant but painful wound. You swim to the boat and climb in and lie for a few moments, gasping for breath, after your ordeal.[/p][p]The small island is close now and soon you are on the shore. The island is a round circle of earth, only a hundred yards across. It is bare of vegetation and the air is cold and clammy, even though the sun beats down brightly from above.

Then you emerge into a clearing, bounded by the mist, so that little light gets through.[/p][p]A heap of skeletal remains lie piled in a corner. Before it stands the Devil-Beast. It is humanoid, with great long arms that hang to the ground. Its hands are inordinately large, ending in vicious black talons. It half-squats, half-stands on two long legs – the thighs are peculiarly powerful, modified for jumping. The lifeless-looking skin is grey and warty, the head – vaguely elfin, but the nose – bulbous and misshapen. Great, yellowed tusks protrude from its drooling mouth and its long thin hair is lank and matted with filth. Its eyes are dull, without intelligence, but they seem to blaze evilly with a malevolent red light. Elvan grace and beauty has been twisted into evil grotesqueness.[/p][p]The Devil-Beast growls low in its throat, then nods at you.

      <Text>[p]‘After your departure, Overlord, the city was calm. As a tenday passed without word of you, those citizens who wished for a new Overlord started a rumour that you would never return, that you had gone to seek the Orb and Sceptre in the Rift and been swallowed up inside that evil place forever. Six days ago, news came that a new army of evil beings had issued forth from the Bowels of Orb to attack the city. Still there was no news of your majesty. The merchants fled the city, taking with them such wares as they could carry. The army and the militia, led by the Demagogue, manned the walls, but the black tide of evil swamped them this morning and great Cave Trolls breached the city wall. Orcs and Dark Elves led by some terrible sorcerous monster have taken much of the city and the eastern quarter burns. The temples on Cross Street still hold out and our forces have retreated to the Plaza of the Infinite Instant before the Temple to Time.’ As he speaks there begins a loud battering on the doors to the Throne Room.

The Orcs have found the Palace wine cellars and are too busy looting to fight.’ Gwyneth motions him away and then confides: ‘Foxglove deserted us.

Indeed, there are more servants than guests, but you go through with this rigmarole for the sake of morale. Fidelio senses the prevailing mood and he sings the ballad of the Honest Tinker, a fable about how a good man triumphs over adversity in the end because he leads his life according to the moral code he believes in. Then he plays something more stirring and you are soon marvelling at the skill of the bards of the Island of the Goddess. Looking around, you see that he is well on the way to captivating the hearts of most of the ladies present. Next he sings the song of the Orb of Kings. The Orb is a green gem that one of the erstwhile kings of Serakub placed in his eye so that he could see invisible beings, but in the end he was killed in his sleep for the gem by ruffians who did not know who it was they killed. At the end of the song he dedicates it to you. When he finishes his minstrelsy there is rapturous applause and you beckon him to join you at your table.

You have until then to prepare for the onslaught.’ Fidelio also tells you that there is much debate at the court of Dom the Prescient, the king of the ancient enemy of Doomover, the City of the Spires of Foreshadowing. Some of the Tools of Fate, the chosen heroes of that goddess, wish to go to war against Honoric if he marches out, but Dom fears that the Forces of Death from Mortavalon will join Honoric if they go to war.

Gwyneth begins by summarising the threat posed by Honoric and reviewing the troops with which you must try once more to save the city. Gwyneth herself commands eighteen hundred sword-arms under the banner of Dama, shieldmaiden of the Gods, eight hundred of whom are well-armoured cavalry. High Priest Lackland, or, as he insists on styling himself at the war council, General Lackland, commands three and a half thousand men and Orcs, the remnants of the Usurper’s army, who were not conspicuously loyal when Shadazar overran the city, although they did not actually join the forces from the Rift. They are all footsoldiers, and less effective than Gwyneth’s soldiers, who are élite battle-hardened troops.

Though lacking a leader, they suffered only small losses when taking and being driven from the city. ‘There is no telling when the Spawn of the Rift will issue forth again from the dark places beneath Orb,’ says Gwyneth. ‘Indeed Fate would truly be smiling on us if they did not attack us again when their carrion crows carry the news of the advance of the Legion of the Sword of Doom.’ Even the Demagogue agrees with everyone that you lack the forces necessary to hope for success.

      <Text>[p]It has become clear to all present that you must seek an ally, one with a professional army that can be ready to campaign in the Manmarch by the first day of Grimweird. All agree that only you have the charisma to persuade another city to come to your aid. But time is running out. You ask for suggestions as to the best choice of a city for you to visit on a diplomatic mission to enlist the support of another army. Greystaff throws up his hands and says that he knows nothing of armies and war but that his Temple will provide healers for the army. The Demagogue makes the first suggestion: ‘Surely there is but one choice, Overlord. The Spires of Foreshadowing have lived under the threat of war from Doomover for all living memory. Their armies have clashed three times this century. With the Tools of Fate on our side we may yet win victory.’[/p][p]Hengist speaks next: ‘The forces of Fate are not our natural allies.

      <Text>[p]As Solstice had said, it is generally held that Upanishad is the largest city on Orb, with more than a million souls. It is also called by some the City of the Redeemer because the followers of Kwon there are so powerful. It caters for as many creeds as Goth or Ten Temples, however, and twice as many species. The most powerful man in the city is reputed to be the Grandmaster of the Stars, whom people call the Right Hand of the Redeemer, but he seldom leaves the Duomo monastery. Upanishad lies between the deltas of the Great and Khesh rivers north of the Jungle of Khesh. It is a hundred days’ journey. Even a sea raid on Doomover could hardly take place before the month of Pantheos, by which time Honoric would have taken Irsmuncast in your absence unless Solstice can find you more time.[/p][p][link target='4261'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

The only other cities in the same valley of the River Greybones are the City of the Runes of Doom and the Walls of Shadow, both cities of the dead. It was once a civilised city from where a large empire was ruled, but that was long ago. The Temple to Moraine is thought to dominate the city, but the scribes find a reference to a Temple to Nemesis and to beastmen. It may well be that the followers of Moraine wish to have an empire again and the only way they can expand is northwards into the Manmarch.[/p][p][link target='4261'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

The largest temples there are to Dama, Béatan the Free, a god who despises law and order but who is not evil, and to Ilexkuneion, a strange nature god whose priests call themselves druids.

The most powerful soldier there is a woman called Alfrida Watchguard. You spent time there on your return journey to the Island of Tranquil Dreams from Quench-heart Keep, and it was because of your presence that the Grandmaster of the Temple to Kwon there was killed by Mandrake, their guildmaster of assassins, but that is all in the past.

It is a city that is full of life and of many different types of people, ruled over by Dom the Prescient and the followers of the goddess Fate. There is also a temple to the wargod Vasch-Ro, He Who Sows for the Reaper, and the followers of Fate see Doomover and the followers of Vasch-Ro as their greatest enemy.

Its shape shifts as if it moved by floating, its feet not quite in contact with the bare earth. You can see nothing through your natural eye; the creature is invisible to normal men.

The tall trees are so close together that they block out almost all the sun’s rays, so that you can hardly tell the difference between day and night.

One is a great ox of a man with a ruddy complexion and the tan and callouses of a man used to sword practice in the sun. The other has the olive-green pallor of one who shuns the sun. He is tall and almost unnaturally thin, as though he suffered from a wasting disease. Strangest of all, however, is the fact that seven spherical gems of different colours hover above his head and move with his movements as if attached to him by invisible wires.

Their nearest neighbour is the fleshless king of the City of the Runes of Doom. They have nowhere to use their military might.

      <Text>[p][image source='115' title='' hspace='5' vspace='5' align='right' width='259' height='409' /]You look around at the hundred Prodromese as you nervously try to decide what to say and in what manner to say it. The Sceptre at your side lends you confidence. The people sealed in the tiered pews of the oval hall could hardly look more different one from another. Many proclaim the deity they serve through their dress. The followers of Béatan are unmistakable. They are spread evenly throughout the hall, but all wear the badge of the five-spoked Wheel of Myriad Possibility. Seated opposite you is a body of men and women who wear the sword and lozenge-shaped shield of Dama. On their right is a group of strange-looking men clad in greens and browns, each wearing a sprig of oak in their hair. You guess them to be the followers of Ilexkuneion, the god of animals and plants. Beyond them you are dismayed to note fifteen or so black whirlpool badges, and next to these a like number of purple and green spiders. Serakub has its share of evil-doers too. Fate and Torremalku the Slayer are also represented, and there are six young priestesses bearing the symbol of a crescent moon, but the identity of their god or goddess eludes you. They are a mixed audience indeed. There will be no secrecy here in the Boule.[/p][p][link target='4285' condition='return player.scarred;']If you are hideously scarred as a result of tearing the emerald Orb from your eye[/link].[br /][link target='4067a' condition='return !player.scarred;']Otherwise[/link].[/p]</Text>

At last the door opens and two people enter. The first is the learned head of the Boule, Obuda Varhegyen, dressed in a long yellow robe bearing the five arrowed half-wheels that signify the many ways to do good deeds, central to the theology of Béatan. Behind him is a most striking woman wearing a plain kirtle and a blue shawl, her coppery hair done up in silk twists. Her blue eyes are warm and soft and she smiles as Obuda introduces her as Hivatala, the Swordsmistress of the Serakub Guard. Your surprise at her title is obvious, and this pleases her. You sit around a small table and they tell you what has passed in the Boule. Only two thousand troops have been voted to help you in the campaign, but Hivatala says that she will call for volunteers to augment this. Obuda also feels that the followers of Béatan at the City of Aveneg in the Manmarch are sure to send men if he sends a message to them, for they are strongly opposed to Honoric. By the time you leave the pleasant City of Gardens, you are beginning to feel that there is hope. Hivatala herself will command the forces of Serakub, and she will arrive with two thousand shieldmaidens, including five hundred mounted troops and a thousand swordsmen of the Army of Myriad Possibility, followers of Béatan.[/p][p][link target='4387'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Rumours that Honoric is on the march reach you and you double the scouting patrols out to the west and also east towards the Rift. It is still possible that your worst fears may be correct, that the Spawn of the Rift are waiting for a chance to strike as Honoric does. The city defences have been repaired, and your troops are drilling daily, though the rabble militia will never make an effective fighting force in time. At last your scouts bring news of friendly troops approaching. The next day the streets are lined with cheering people as Hivatala, Swordsmistress of the Guard at Serakub, leads into the city a force as large as she had promised; two and a half thousand foot soldiers, shieldmaidens and reverencers of Béatan, and five hundred cavalry whose horsemanship is a joy to behold. Four days later another force arrives of two thousand, six hundred of whom are the illustrious Cavalry of Myriad Possibility, and similar scenes of jubilation are re-enacted. The shieldmaidens fit in well with Gwyneth’s troops in their grey, white and green, with the shield of Dama blazoned everywhere, while the followers of Béatan look equally splendid in their yellow surcoats.

As dusk falls, a manor house appears ahead, it seems deserted, and as you rein in your horse you see the reason why. A half-mile beyond, a great army is settling down for the night’s camp. The rosy glow of the setting sun seems to set aflame the gleaming steel of fifteen thousand spears, and the sound of many men bivouacking fills the evening air. As you watch, your spirit sinks at the sight of such a mighty army. You recognise banners not only of Doomover but of the cities of Aveneg, Greyguilds, Mortavalon and others. Honoric has been hard at work – a powerful alliance of cities is ranged against you. You must try to learn more.[/p][p][link target='4012'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]Dawn breaks. Examine the map opposite. Currently your army is encamped along the Greenridge and Tallhill. As the sun rises you can see a stream of village refugees hurrying over the Old Bridge and down the road. The reason is obvious. Sprawled around the Manor House is the army of Honoric, the leader of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, their lines stretching from Sawdon Freeman’s Farm to Squires Hill. Your scouts, Glaivas’ Rangers, are out at the stream, as are the scouts of the Legion. Soon they will return with news.

Their discussion goes on to the men of the legions of Aveneg and the Spires; regular troops, but not as good as themselves.

Antocidas’ mercenaries can hold the Old Farm, with some cavalry positioned on Colwyn’s Mound, and then a line of units stretching to the Greenridge, with the centre resting in Hartwig Fell’s Farm. A thousand men could be held in reserve on Tallhill, where the Overlord Avenger’s command post should be. Finally, I would suggest that Glaivas and his Rangers should wait in ambush at the Old Bridge to hold it for as long as possible should any try to cross it.’[/p][p]Doré le Jeune leaps up and says: ‘No, no. We should attack, though we are outnumbered! Take the fight to Honoric and his black-hearted lackeys! Put all our cavalry and four thousand of our best footmen before the stream between Woodnugget Wood and the Wickerwood. Gliftel’s fine bowmen could occupy Woodnugget Wood to give flanking fire as I and my comrades personally lead the charge to drive through to the open ground beyond Manor Ridge, from whence we can strike back to the ford or on to the Manor. The rest of our army should hold Hartwig Fell’s Farm in case of a flank attack from across the ford. The Overlord’s council post should be on Colwyn’s Mound, from where Avenger can give support to the attack, along with the White Mage of Avatar.’ At this point Doré le Jeune bows respectfully to the old magician.[/p][p][link target='4254'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Honoric’s soldiers on the far left begin to advance over Rune’s Bridge at a fast trot. When they have reached Bridgebeam, the Levies, the Legion of the Angel of Death and the Warrior Women of Horngroth begin to advance across the ford. Then a great guttural roar goes up from the Legion of the Sword of Doom and the massed cavalry. They surge forwards, charging hell-for-leather for the men of the Spires stationed between Hartwig Fell’s Farm and Colwyn’s Mound. You can see some of Honoric’s officers cursing – it seems his cavalry are impetuous and have moved too early. In any case, the long line of cavalry led by the Bringer of Doom Cataphracts, whose horses are clad from head to toe in gleaming armour, plunge forwards, howling – a daunting sight. However, as they come nearer the ditch they begin to lose formation, some horses trip and all is confused for a moment.[/p][p]Your Corps of Bannermen – some twenty standard-bearers with banners particular to individual units – stand nearby ready to signal your orders to your men.

The troops at the ford charge forwards to engage the men of Fiendil there but not the Legion of Death, which hangs back. As the troops cross the ditch they lose formation somewhat, taking the impetus out of their charge. It looks as if the men of Fiendil are standing firm. The Levies on the far left do nothing; the women of Dama glare across the bridge at them, shaking their fists. But it is on the right that the fighting is fiercest. The two thousand crossbowmen, the Rain of Doom, run forwards with military precision and open fire at the men nearest the copse, causing many casualties. Some of the priestesses of Avatar are busy there already. The Legion, all five thousand, advances close behind. An Elf emerges from the copse and signals to you – he is asking for orders. Your Corps of Bannermen, twenty warriors with banners particular to your units, are ready to signal to units anywhere on the battlefield. You order Gliftel to open fire on the Legion of the Sword of Doom when it launches an attack.[/p][p][link target='4134'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

Honoric’s allies at the ford also charge forwards, but meet staunch resistance from the Warrior Women of Serakub and a bitter mêlée ensues. On the far left the Doomover Levies stream across the bridge, but in the confined space Gwyneth’s soldiers are cutting them down in droves.

Immediately Honoric’s crossbowmen, the Rain of Death, run forwards and two thousand crossbow bolts fly at Antocidas’ mercenaries. The Legion of the Sword of Doom advances to the ditch to engage Gwyneth’s warriors. The Bringers of Death charge forwards at the women, while the cavalry of the Spires charges at the mercenaries. A great battle cry goes up as the attack begins.[/p][p]Simultaneously Honoric’s allies also begin a full-blooded assault on the men of Aveneg defending the ford, but the Levies on the far left make no attempt to take Ruric’s Bridge. The Legion of the Sword of Doom and the cavalry become disordered as they try to cross the ford, and their attack loses impetus, enabling Gwyneth’s warriors to inflict many casualties as their attackers reach them almost in dribs and drabs. But then the Monks of the Scarlet Mantis suddenly burst out of the Wickerwood to fall on the flanks of Antocidas’ mercenaries with devastating effect. Under the deadly rain of bolts, the cavalry attack and the crippling flank attack, the mercenaries, having lost over a third of their men within a few minutes, just break and run.

Then there is a guttural roar and Honoric’s allies charge forwards. This is too much for your cavalry; despite Doré le Jeune the men break and run, harried by the wyverns that are killing indiscriminately.[/p][p]You leap on to your horse to try to intercept the cavalry – you will have to rally it or the battle will be lost for sure.

The wyverns flap upwards, forced to leave the fleeing horsemen to deal with the Mage.[/p][p]The men of the Spires receive the charge of Honoric’s allies and there is a resounding crash of steel on steel. Battle is joined, and the clash of weapons and the cries of the wounded fill the air – but your men are holding, just. Desperately, you canter off to meet the now decimated cavalry, which is set to flee off the field. On the far left the Legion of the Sword of Doom and its cavalry are charging the defenders at the farm repeatedly. The fighting is desperate, but your men look strong enough to hold on there for a little longer.[/p][p]Towards you come the fleeing horsemen, some thousand left. You rein in your horse and raise your Sceptre high, calling on the power of the Sceptre, your false eye glowing with light. To me, warriors, to me.

      <Text>[p]On your triumphal return to the city, the streets of Irsmuncast had been strewn with flowers. Your victory against Honoric and the Legion of the Sword of Doom has made you the darling of the people. The months that follow are among the happiest of your life. As Overlord you will never be carefree, but your reign is now blessed with peace both within and without the city walls. The Forces of the Rift had largely melted away when news of Honoric’s defeat reached them and there have been no more raids from the Rift, the gaping chasm that men call the Bowels of Orb, since that glorious day. Your friends Glaivas the Ranger-Lord and the Paladin, Doré le Jeune, became themselves fast friends during the celebrations, and at the zealous Paladins’ suggestion, and against his better judgement, Glaivas allowed himself to be persuaded to accompany Doré on a punitive expedition to the Rift. They left almost a month ago to the day, and now, first day of Pantheos, they are due to arrive back at court at any time.[/p][p]Gwyneth, Force-Lady of the shieldmaidens of Dama, continues to oversee the keeping of law and of the military with her customary efficiency, and the Demagogue has persuaded you to sponsor a series of new buildings which he hopes will spark renaissance for the city. The Treasury is empty and you have had to borrow to make payments to the dependants of those killed in the war, but the people are happy. Your allies have returned home with gifts to show that they can count on you for allegiance should they ever fall under attack.

      <Text>[p]You cannot ask another to share with you the dangers of the Rift. Foxglove must come with you as punishment for deserting her city in its time of need. She may be useful to you. But there is no point in taking an armed band. No matter how large, it would be outnumbered by the denizens of the Rift. Stealth will be your greatest asset. You take the Sceptre and swathe it in black cloth, then hide it inside your Ninja costume. Leaving Gwyneth orders to publish the news that you are journeying to meet two saviours of the city, you set off to that darkest pit of evil, the Bowels of Orb. One other artefact you take from the royal armoury, the Torch of Lumen, an ebony rod topped by a cone of alabaster. When the alabaster is touched it gives off a constant light that will be invaluable in the eternal darkness of the Rift.[script]context.addItem(player, 'torchOfLumen');[/script][/p][p][link target='5145'](continue)[/link][/p]</Text>

      <Text>[p]The Rift has been a cauldron of evil since time immemorial. All manner of wicked and unnatural creatures spawn there, giving rise to an endless stream of evil pouring from the dark chasm across the lands of men. Dark Elves, sisters of Nullaq, Orcs, Old Ones, Sons of Nil, Plague-Trolls, these are but a few of the denizens lurking in the unending darkness. The chasm itself is like an immense gorge surrounded by a honeycomb of natural tunnels and carven halls, which stretch to the very centre of Orb.

The floor has been plated with metal on to which a huge bloated spider shape has been cut with acid. The spider has only four legs, one at each corner of its huge body, each of which points towards a tunnel exit. The tunnel by which you entered, to which the right back leg points, is suddenly blocked by a wall of flame, and the heat forces you forwards to the centre of the spider’s body. A ghastly figure enters the chamber from the opposite tunnel. It is a Dark Elf in a robe of purple and green but the usually beautiful jet-black face is horribly contorted. Eight splayed legs and a bloated spider’s body project from below the chin, as if half a huge spider had been grafted on to her face. It is one of the sisters of Nullaq, dreaded magicians whose mothers have mated with one of the three Mother-Spiders in the deeper vaults of the Rift. She gestures you to leave the chamber by the tunnel indicated by the etching’s front right leg.[/p][p]Will you [link target='5352']do so[/link], [link target='5020']try to kill the sister of Nullaq[/link] or [link target='5040']try to leave by the other free entrance, guarded by two statues, behind you and to the left[/link]?[/p]</Text>

In shape it is like a chameleon, with huge pincers and claws and feeding tentacles around its cavernous maw. Everyone cries out in panic and begins to run. The Krathak is not alone.

He leaps into the statue’s open mouth and is lost to view. You sprint towards the statue as the Krathak’s stinking breath bathes you and its footfalls shake the earth. Soon everyone has jumped into the statue’s mouth. Cassandra is the last, just ahead of you. As she leaps there is a cracking noise and the statue turns to grey-green scaly flesh. The Worldworm is coming to life. As quick as thought, Cassandra thrusts her blade into the roof of the Worldworm’s mouth to prevent its closing upon her.

Cassandra tries to grab hold of you but loses her grip and you hear her cursing fervently in despair, as her god will not help her. You try to call upon Kwon the Redeemer, but still you fall. Then you are wreathed in a gossamer thread, as smooth as silk, that slows your descent to the middle of Orb. You fall more slowly now, until at last you come gently to rest in a great cocoon of silk.

It is important to pay attention to them because they can affect the outcome of the game.[/p][p][bold]Modification tags[/bold][/p][p]Modification tags denote a change in the player's attributes, such as Endurance. Red tags indicate reductions, green tags indicate increments. For example:[/p][p]You lose [tag]minus:return 4;[/tag] Endurance and gain [tag]plus:return 1;[/tag] to your Inner force.[/p][p][bold]Information tags[/bold][/p][p]Information tags are used to empashize potentially useful information, such as change in the opponent's Endurance, combat rolls and calculations, etc. For example:[/p][p]You roll [tag]info:return 5;[/tag] and hit your opponent for [tag]info:return 6;[/tag].[/p][p][bold]Actions[/bold][/p][p]Actions involve interaction from the player and are represented by small clickable buttons. Most actions are blocking, that is, in order to continue, the player must take the action by clicking on the button. Actions are often (but not always) preceeded by choices (see Choices below). For example:[/p][p][tag]general:return 'Make a Roll';[/tag][/p][p][bold]Items[/bold][/p][p]Items are displayed in text with special tags. Usually items found by the player are automatically added to the inventory. However, in rare cases items need to be clicked on in order to pick them up (see Pickable items below). You can hover over an item for more information about it. For example:[/p][p]You have found a [tag]item:return context.getItem('healingPotion');[/tag] and a [tag]item:return context.getItem('goldSignetRing');[/tag].[/p][p][bold]Pickable items[/bold][/p][p]Most items are automatically picked up by the player, but some are not and need to be clicked on in order to be acquired. Make sure you don't leave behind an item of interest. Pickable items, similarly to actions, are highlighted in gold. For example:[/p][p][script]$.itemPickedUp = null;
$.items = null;
$.item = context.createItem('ruby', 4);[/script]You find [embed value='ItemPickup' /] and [script]$.item = context.createItem('gold', 9);[/script][embed value='ItemPickup' /].[/p][p][bold]References[/bold][/p][p]References are small tags providing information about a skill or an attribute. When hovered over, these tags provide additional tooltip information about the reference. For example:[/p][p]You learned the skill of [tag]skill:return context.getSkill('poisonNeedles');[/tag].[/p][p][bold]Options[/bold][/p][p]Options are usually displayed in combination with blocking actions. They provide the player with the ability to select one or more toggles before executing the action. For example:[/p][p]Before attacking you can use [script]$.choiceSelected = false;[/script][clicker]$.actionSelected = !$.actionSelected;
return $.actionSelected;[/clicker][tag]selectSkill:return context.getSkill('innerForce');[/tag][endclicker /]. [tag]general:return 'Attack';[/tag][/p][p][bold]Choices[/bold][/p][p]Choices are represented by classic hyperlinks. Clicking on a link will transition to a new episode. Sometimes choices have requirements. If the requirements are items or skills, they are listed in front of the link. For example:[/p][p][tag]skill:return context.getSkill('arrowCutting');[/tag] [link target='script:1' script='context.showPopupMessage(&amp;apos;You clicked the link.

        <Attribute Id="description">You begin the adventure with five ‘Shuriken’. The type you specialise in are ‘throwing stars’, small razor sharp star shaped disks of metal. You can throw these up to a range of about 30 feet with devastating effect. If you throw a Shuriken, you will be given a Defence number for your target. Roll two dice, and if the score is higher than the Defence number, you will have hit your target. If this is the case, roll one die. The score is the amount of damage the Shuriken does. Subtract it from your target’s Endurance. You may find yourself in a position where you are unable to retrieve a Shuriken once you have thrown it. If you have none left, you can no longer use this skill.</Attribute>
